<H3>compute event/displace command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>compute ID group-ID event/displace threshold 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID, group-ID are documented in <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> command
<LI>event/displace = style name of this compute command
<LI>threshold = minimum distance a single particle must move to trigger an event (distance units) 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>compute 1 all event/displace 0.5 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a computation that flags an event if any particle in the group
has moved a distance greater than the specified threshold distance
when compared to a previously stored reference state (i.e. the
previous event).  This compute is typically used in conjunction with
the <A HREF = "prd.html">prd</A> command to detect if a transition to a new minimum
energy basin has occurred.
</P>
<P>This flag value calculates is equal to 0 if no particle has moved far
enough and 1 if one or more particles have moved further than the
threshold distance.
</P>
<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>The scalar value calculated by this compute is "intensive", meaning it
is independent of the number of atoms in the simulation.
