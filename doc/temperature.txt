temperature command :h3

[Syntax:]

temperature ID group-ID style args keyword value ... :pre

ID = user-assigned name for the temperature :ulb,l
group-ID = ID of group of atoms to compute the temperature for :l
style = {full} or {partial} or {ramp} or {region} :l
 {full} args = none
 {partial} args = x y z
    x,y,z = 0 or 1
 {ramp} args = vdim vlo vhi dim clo chi
    vdim = {vx} or {vy} or {vz}
    vlo,vhi = subtract velocities between vlo and vhi (velocity units)
    dim = {x} or {y} or {z}
    clo,chi = lower and upper bound of domain to
    	      subtract from (distance units)
 {region} args = region-ID
    region-ID = ID of region to use for choosing atoms :pre
zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended to the args :l
keyword = {units} :l
  {units} value = {lattice} or {box} :pre
:ule

[Description:]

Define a method for computing the temperature of a group of atoms.

The ID of the temperature can be referred to in other commands, such
as "thermo_modify"_thermo_modify.html, "velocity"_velocity.html,
"fix_modify"_fix_modify.html, "temp_modify"_temp_modify.html.  Note
that certain fixes create their own temperatures with the same ID as
the fix, e.g. "fix temp/rescale"_fix_temp_rescale.html, "fix
nvt"_fix_nvt.html, "fix npt"_fix_npt.html, etc.

The style determines how the temperature is computed.  The {full}
style means KE = dim/2 N k T, where KE = total kinetic energy of the
group of atoms (sum of 1/2 m v^2), dim = 2 or 3 = dimensionality of
the simulation, N = number of atoms in the group, k = Boltzmann
constant, and T = temperature.

The {partial} style uses the same formula as {full}, except entire
dimensions can be eliminated from the kinetic energy computation.
This can be useful for systems where atoms are flowing, and only the
thermal temperature in the non-flow directions is desired.  A "0"
means do not use the component of velocity in that dimension when
computing KE.  In the example above with arguments 1 1 0, only x and y
velocities (not z) would be used in computing KE and temperature.

The {ramp} style can be used to eliminate an imposed velocity on a
system before computing thermal KE.  The meaning of these arguments is
the same as for the "velocity"_velocity.html command which was
presumably used to impose the velocity.

The {region} style is the same as {full} except that only atoms in the
specified geometric region contribute to the temperature.  Since atoms
can enter/leave a region, this test is performed each time the
temperature is computed.  This can be useful for thermostatting one
portion of the simulation box.  E.g. a McDLT simulation where one side
is cooled, and the other side is heated.

Note that a {region}-style temperature can be used to thermostat with
"fix temp/rescale"_fix_temp_rescale.html or "fix
langevin"_fix_langevin.html, but should probably not be used with
Nose/Hoover style fixes ("fix nvt"_fix_nvt.html, fix
npt"_fix_npt.html, or "fix nph"_fix_nph.html), if the
degrees-of-freedom included in the computed T varies with time.

The {units} keyword determines the meaning of the distance units used
for coordinates (c1,c2) and velocities (vlo,vhi) defined for the
{ramp} style.  A {box} value selects standard distance units as
defined by the "units"_units.html command, e.g. Angstroms for units =
real or metal.  A {lattice} value means the distance units are in
lattice spacings; e.g. velocity = lattice spacings / tau.  The
"lattice"_lattice.html command must have been previously used to
define the lattice spacing.

LAMMPS defines a temperature with ID = {default} which computes a
{full} style on the {all} group of atoms.  This is the temperature
used for thermodynamic output of quantities like temperature,
pressure, kinetic energy (see the "thermo_style"_thermo_style.html
command) unless you change it via the
"thermo_modify"_thermo_modify.html command.

All temperature styles (except {region}) subtract out
degrees-of-freedom (DOF) due to fixes that constrain molecular motion.
Currently, these are "fix shake"_fix_shake.html and "fix
rigid"_fix_rigid.html.  DOF is the N * dim factor in the above
equation for the {full} style.  This means the temperature of groups
of atoms that include these constraints will be computed correctly.
If needed, the subtracted degrees-of-freedom can be tweaked using the
"temp_modify"_temp_modify.html command.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:]

"thermo_modify"_thermo_modify.html, "velocity"_velocity.html,
"fix_modify"_fix_modify.html, "temp_modify"_temp_modify.html

[Default:]

A temperature with ID = {default} is defined by LAMMPS, as if it had
been specified as "temperature default all full".  The option default
is units = lattice.
