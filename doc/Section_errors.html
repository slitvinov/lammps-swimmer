<H3>9. Errors 
</H3>
<P>This section describes the various kinds of errors you can encounter
when using LAMMPS.

<A NAME = "9_1"></A><H4>9.1 Common problems 
</H4>
<P>If two LAMMPS runs do not produce the same answer on different
machines or different numbers of processors, this is typically not a
bug.  In theory you should get identical answers on any number of
processors and on any machine.  In practice, numerical round-off can
cause slight differences and eventual divergence of molecular dynamics
phase space trajectories within a few 100s or few 1000s of timesteps.
However, the statistical properties of the two runs (e.g. average
energy or temperature) should still be the same.
</P>
<P>If the <A HREF = "velocity.html">velocity</A> command is used to set initial atom
velocities, a particular atom can be assigned a different velocity
when the problem on different machines.  Obviously, this means the
phase space trajectories of the two simulations will rapidly diverge.
See the discussion of the <I>loop</I> option in the
<A HREF = "velocity.html">velocity</A> command for details.
</P>
<P>A LAMMPS simulation typically has two stages, setup and run.  Most
LAMMPS errors are detected at setup time; others like a bond
stretching too far may not occur until the middle of a run.
</P>
<P>LAMMPS tries to flag errors and print informative error messages so
you can fix the problem.  Of course LAMMPS cannot figure out your
physics mistakes, like choosing too big a timestep, specifying invalid
force field coefficients, or putting 2 atoms on top of each other!  If
you find errors that LAMMPS doesn't catch that you think it should
flag, please send an email to the
<A HREF = "http://lammps.sandia.gov/authors.html">developers</A>.
</P>
<P>If you get an error message about an invalid command in your input
script, you can determine what command is causing the problem by
looking in the log.lammps file or using the <A HREF = "echo.html">echo command</A>
to see it on the screen.  For a given command, LAMMPS expects certain
arguments in a specified order.  If you mess this up, LAMMPS will
often flag the error, but it may read a bogus argument and assign a
value that is valid, but not what you wanted.  E.g. trying to read the
string "abc" as an integer value and assigning the associated variable
a value of 0.
</P>
<P>Generally, LAMMPS will print a message to the screen and exit
gracefully when it encounters a fatal error.  Sometimes it will print
a WARNING and continue on; you can decide if the WARNING is important
or not.  If LAMMPS crashes or hangs without spitting out an error
message first then it could be a bug (see <A HREF = "#9_2">this section</A>) or one
of the following cases:
</P>
<P>LAMMPS runs in the available memory a processor allows to be
allocated.  Most reasonable MD runs are compute limited, not memory
limited, so this shouldn't be a bottleneck on most platforms.  Almost
all large memory allocations in the code are done via C-style malloc's
which will generate an error message if you run out of memory.
Smaller chunks of memory are allocated via C++ "new" statements.  If
you are unlucky you could run out of memory just when one of these
small requests is made, in which case the code will crash or hang (in
parallel), since LAMMPS doesn't trap on those errors.
</P>
<P>Illegal arithmetic can cause LAMMPS to run slow or crash.  This is
typically due to invalid physics and numerics that your simulation is
computing.  If you see wild thermodynamic values or NaN values in your
LAMMPS output, something is wrong with your simulation.
</P>
<P>In parallel, one way LAMMPS can hang is due to how different MPI
implementations handle buffering of messages.  If the code hangs
without an error message, it may be that you need to specify an MPI
setting or two (usually via an environment variable) to enable
buffering or boost the sizes of messages that can be buffered.
</P>

<A NAME = "9_2"></A><H4>9.2 Reporting bugs 
</H4>
<P>If you are confident that you have found a bug in LAMMPS, please send
an email to the <A HREF = "http://lammps.sandia.gov/authors.html">developers</A>.
</P>
<P>First, check the "New features and bug fixes" section of the <A HREF = "http://lammps.sandia.gov">LAMMPS
WWW site</A> to see if the bug has already been reported or fixed.
</P>
<P>If not, the most useful thing you can do for us is to isolate the
problem.  Run it on the smallest number of atoms and fewest number of
processors and with the simplest input script that reproduces the bug.
</P>
<P>In your email, describe the problem and any ideas you have as to what
is causing it or where in the code the problem might be.  We'll
request your input script and data files if necessary.
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "9_3"></A>9.3 Error & warning messages 
</H4>
<P>These are two alphabetic lists of the <A HREF = "#error">ERROR</A> and
<A HREF = "#warn">WARNING</A> messages LAMMPS prints out and the reason why.  If the
explanation here is not sufficient, the documentation for the
offending command may help.  Grepping the source files for the text of
the error message and staring at the source code and comments is also
not a bad idea!  Note that sometimes the same message can be printed
from multiple places in the code.
</P>
<P>Also note that error messages from <A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_3">user-contributed
packages</A> are not listed here.  Is such an
error occurs and is not self-explanatory, you'll need to look in the
source code or contact the author of the package.
</P>

<H4><A NAME = "warn"></A>Warnings: 
</H4>
<DL>

<DT><I>Dihedral problem: %d %d %d %d %d %d</I> 

<DD>Conformation of the 4 listed dihedral atoms is extreme; you may want
to check your simulation geometry. 

<DT><I>Dump dcd/xtc timestamp may be wrong with fix dt/reset</I> 

<DD>If the fix changes the timestep, the dump dcd file will not
reflect the change. 

<DT><I>FENE bond too long: %d %d %d %g</I> 

<DD>A FENE bond has stretched dangerously far.  It's interaction strength
will be truncated to attempt to prevent the bond from blowing up. 

<DT><I>FENE bond too long: %d %g</I> 

<DD>A FENE bond has stretched dangerously far.  It's interaction strength
will be truncated to attempt to prevent the bond from blowing up. 

<DT><I>Fix recenter should come after all other integration fixes</I> 

<DD>Other fixes may change the position of the center-of-mass, so 
fix recenter should come last. 

<DT><I>Fix wall/reflect should come after all other integration fixes</I> 

<DD>This is because other integration fixes may alter the coordinates
of an atom, so you want to reflect it back into the box only after
the other fixes have made their adjustments. 

<DT><I>Group for fix_modify temp != fix group</I> 

<DD>The fix_modify command is specifying a temperature computation that
computes a temperature on a different group of atoms than the fix
itself operates on.  This is probably not what you want to do. 

<DT><I>Improper problem: %d %d %d %d %d %d</I> 

<DD>Conformation of the 4 listed improper atoms is extreme; you may want
to check your simulation geometry. 

<DT><I>Less insertions than requested</I> 

<DD>Less atom insertions occurred on this timestep due to the fix insert
command than were scheduled.  This is probably because there were too
many overlaps detected. 

<DT><I>Lost atoms: original %.15g current %.15g</I> 

<DD>A thermodynamic computation has detected lost atoms. 

<DT><I>Mismatch between velocity and compute groups</I> 

<DD>The temperature computation used by the velocity command will not be
on the same group of atoms that velocities are being set for. 

<DT><I>More than one compute centro/atom</I> 

<DD>It is not efficient to use compute centro/atom  more than once. 

<DT><I>More than one compute coord/atom</I> 

<DD>It is not efficient to use compute coord/atom more than once. 

<DT><I>More than one compute ke/atom</I> 

<DD>It is not efficient to use compute ke/atom more than once. 

<DT><I>More than one fix msd</I> 

<DD>It is not efficient to use fix msd more than once. 

<DT><I>More than one fix poems</I> 

<DD>It is not efficient to use fix poems more than once. 

<DT><I>More than one fix rigid</I> 

<DD>It is not efficient to use fix rigid more than once. 

<DT><I>No fixes defined, atoms won't move</I> 

<DD>If you are not using a fix like nve, nvt, npt then atom velocities and
coordinates will not be updated during timestepping. 

<DT><I>No joints between rigid bodies, use fix rigid instead</I> 

<DD>The bodies defined by fix poems are not connected by joints.  POEMS
will integrate the body motion, but it would be more efficient to use
fix rigid. 

<DT><I>One or more respa levels compute no forces</I> 

<DD>This is computationally inefficient. 

<DT><I>Particle deposition was unsuccessful</I> 

<DD>The fix deposit command was not able to insert as many atoms as
needed.  The requested volume fraction may be too high, or other atoms
may be in the insertion region. 

<DT><I>Replacing a fix, but new group != old group</I> 

<DD>The ID and style of a fix match for a fix you are changing with a fix
command, but the new group you are specifying does not match the old
group. 

<DT><I>Replicating in a non-periodic dimension</I> 

<DD>The parameters for a replicate command will cause a non-periodic
dimension to be replicated; this may cause unwanted behavior. 

<DT><I>Resetting angle_style to restart file value</I> 

<DD>The angle style defined in the LAMMPS input script does not match that
of the restart file. 

<DT><I>Resetting bond_style to restart file value</I> 

<DD>The bond style defined in the LAMMPS input script does not match that
of the restart file. 

<DT><I>Resetting boundary settings to restart file values</I> 

<DD>The boundary settings defined in the LAMMPS input script do not match
that of the restart file. 

<DT><I>Resetting dihedral_style to restart file value</I> 

<DD>The dihedral style defined in the LAMMPS input script does not match
that of the restart file. 

<DT><I>Resetting dimension to restart file value</I> 

<DD>The dimension value defined in the LAMMPS input script does not match
that of the restart file. 

<DT><I>Resetting improper_style to restart file value</I> 

<DD>The improper style defined in the LAMMPS input script does not match
that of the restart file. 

<DT><I>Resetting newton bond to restart file value</I> 

<DD>The value of the newton setting for bonds defined in the LAMMPS input
script does not match that of the restart file. 

<DT><I>Resetting pair_style to restart file value</I> 

<DD>The pair style defined in the LAMMPS input script does not match that
of the restart file. 

<DT><I>Resetting reneighboring criteria during minimization</I> 

<DD>Minimization requires that neigh_modify settings be delay = 0, every =
1, check = yes.  Since these settings were not in place, LAMMPS
changed them and will restore them to their original values after the
minimization. 

<DT><I>Resetting unit_style to restart file value</I> 

<DD>The unit style defined in the LAMMPS input script does not match that
of the restart file. 

<DT><I>Restart file used different # of processors</I> 

<DD>The restart file was written out by a LAMMPS simulation running on a
different number of processors.  Due to round-off, the trajectories of
your restarted simulation may diverge a little more quickly than if
you ran on the same # of processors. 

<DT><I>Restart file used different 3d processor grid</I> 

<DD>The restart file was written out by a LAMMPS simulation running on a
different 3d grid of processors.  Due to round-off, the trajectories
of your restarted simulation may diverge a little more quickly than if
you ran on the same # of processors. 

<DT><I>Restart file used different newton pair setting</I> 

<DD>The restart file was written out by a LAMMPS simulation running with a
different value of the newton pair setting.  The new simulation will
use the value from the input script. 

<DT><I>Restart file version does not match LAMMPS version</I> 

<DD>The version of LAMMPS that wrote the restart file does not match the
version of LAMMPS that is reading the restart file.  Generally this
shouldn't be a problem, since restart file formats won't change very
often if at all.  But if they do, the code will probably crash trying
to read the file.  Versions of LAMMPS are specified by a date. 

<DT><I>Shake determinant < 0.0</I> 

<DD>The determinant of the quadratic equation being solved for a single
cluster specified by the fix shake command is numerically suspect.  LAMMPS
will set it to 0.0 and continue. 

<DT><I>Slab parameter < 2.0 may cause unphysical behavior</I> 

<DD>The kspace_modify slab parameter should be larger to insure periodic
grids padded with empty space do not overlap. 

<DT><I>System is not charge neutral, net charge = %g</I> 

<DD>The total charge on all atoms on the system is not 0.0, which
is not valid for Ewald or PPPM. 

<DT><I>Table inner cutoff >= outer cutoff</I> 

<DD>You specified an inner cutoff for a Coulombic table that is longer
than the global cutoff.  Probably not what you wanted. 

<DT><I>Temperature for NPH is not for group all</I> 

<DD>User-assigned temperature to NPH fix does not compute temperature for
all atoms.  Since NPH computes a global pressure, the kinetic energy
contribution from the temperature is assumed to also be for all atoms.
Thus the pressure used by NPH could be inaccurate. 

<DT><I>Temperature for NPT is not for group all</I> 

<DD>User-assigned temperature to NPT fix does not compute temperature for
all atoms.  Since NPT computes a global pressure, the kinetic energy
contribution from the temperature is assumed to also be for all atoms.
Thus the pressure used by NPT could be inaccurate. 

<DT><I>Temperature for thermo pressure is not for group all</I> 

<DD>User-assigned temperature to thermo via the thermo_modify command does
not compute temperature for all atoms.  Since thermo computes a global
pressure, the kinetic energy contribution from the temperature is
assumed to also be for all atoms.  Thus the pressure printed by thermo
could be inaccurate. 

<DT><I>Using compute temp/deform with inconsistent fix deform remap option</I> 

<DD>Fix nvt/sllod assumes deforming atoms have a velocity profile provided
by "remap v" or "remap none" as a fix deform option. 

<DT><I>Using compute temp/deform with no fix deform defined</I> 

<DD>Self-explanatory. 

<DT><I>Using pair tail corrections with nonperiodic system</I> 

<DD>This is probably a bogus thing to do, since tail corrections are
computed by integrating the density of a periodic system out to
infinity.
