pair_style lubricate command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style lubricate mu squeeze shear pump twist cutinner cutoff :pre

mu = viscosity (mass/length/time units)
squeeze = 0/1 for squeeze force off/on
shear = 0/1 for shear force off/on
pump = 0/1 for pump force off/on
twist = 0/1 for twist force off/on
cutinner = (distance units)
cutoff = outer cutoff for interactions (distance units) :ul

[Examples:]

pair_style lubricate 1.5 1 1 1 0 2.3 2.4
pair_coeff 1 1 1.8 2.0
pair_coeff * * :pre

[Description:]

Style {lubricate} computes pairwise interactions between mono-disperse
spherical particles with the formula in Appendix A of "(Ball and
Melrose)"_#Ball which has 4 terms describing different types of
lubrication forces between pairs of particles in a background implicit
solvent, each of which is proportional in strength to the viscosity of
the solvent {mu}.

These pair-wise forces and torques are a combination of four modes of
pair-wise interaction: squeezing, shearing, pumping, and twisting.
Each of these modes can be turned on or off with flags in the
pair_style command.

Unlike most pair potentials, the two specified cutoffs (cutinner and
cutoff) refer to the surface-to-surface separation between two
particles, not center-to-center distance.  Currently, this pair style
can only be used for mono-disperse spheres (same radii), so that
separation is r_ij - 2*radius, where r_ij is the center-to-center
distance between the particles.  Within the inner cutoff {cutinner},
the forces and torques are evaluated at a separation of cutinner.  The
outer {cutoff} is the separation distance beyond which the pair-wise
forces are zero.

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atoms
types via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command as in the examples
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
"read_data"_read_data.html or "read_restart"_read_restart.html
commands, or by mixing as described below:

cutinner (distance units)
cutoff (distance units) :ul

The two coefficients are optional.  If neither is specified, the two
cutoffs specified in the pair_style command are used.  Otherwise both
must be specified.

[Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, per-atom energy/stress,
restart, rRESPA info]:

For atom type pairs I,J and I != J, the two cutoff distances for this
pair style can be mixed.  The default mix value is {geometric}.  See
the "pair_modify" command for details.

This pair style does not support the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html
shift option for the energy of the pair interaction.

The "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html table option is not relevant
for this pair style.

This pair style does not support the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html
tail option for adding long-range tail corrections to energy and
pressure.

This pair style does not calculate per-atom energy and stress, as used
by the "compute epair/atom"_compute_epair_atom.html, "compute
stress/atom"_compute_stress_atom.html, and "dump custom"_dump.html
commands.

This pair style writes its information to "binary restart
files"_restart.html, so pair_style and pair_coeff commands do not need
to be specified in an input script that reads a restart file.

This pair style can only be used via the {pair} keyword of the
"run_style respa"_run_style.html command.  It does not support the
{inner}, {middle}, {outer} keywords.

[Restrictions:]

Because this poential computes forces and torques on particles, the
atom style must support particles whose size is set via the
"shape"_shape.html command.  This is "atom_style"_atom_style.html
ellipsoid and dipole.  Since only spherical mono-disperse particles
are currently allowed for pair_style lubricate, this means the 3 shape
radii for all particle types must be the same.

"pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html

[Default:] none
