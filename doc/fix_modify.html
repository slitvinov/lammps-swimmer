<H3>fix_modify command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>fix_modify fix-ID keyword value ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>fix-ID = ID of the fix to modify 

<LI>one or more keyword/value pairs may be appended 

<LI>keyword = <I>temp</I> or <I>press</I> or <I>energy</I> 

<PRE>  <I>temp</I> value = compute ID that calculates a temperature
  <I>press</I> value = compute ID that calculates a pressure
  <I>energy</I> value = <I>yes</I> or <I>no</I> 
</PRE>

</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>fix_modify 3 temp myTemp press myPress
fix_modify 1 energy yes 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Modify one or more parameters of a previously defined fix.  Not all
fix styles support all parameters.
</P>
<P>The <I>temp</I> keyword is used to determine how a fix computes
temperature.  The specified compute ID must have been previously
defined by the user via the <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> command and it must
be a style of compute that calculates a temperature.  All fixes that
compute temperatures defined their own compute by default, as
described in their documentation.  Thus this option allows the user to
override the default method for computing T.
</P>
<P>The <I>press</I> keyword is used to determine how a fix computes pressure.
The specified compute ID must have been previously defined by the user
via the <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> command and it must be a style of
compute that calculates a pressure.  All fixes that compute pressures
defined their own compute by default, as described in their
documentation.  Thus this option allows the user to override the
default method for computing P.
</P>
<P>For fixes that calculates a contribution to the potential energy of
the system, the <I>energy</I> keyword will include that contribution in
thermodyanmic output of the potential energy, as invoked by the
<A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermo_style</A> command.  The value of the
contribution can also be printed by itself using the <A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermo_style
custom</A> keywords.  The documentation for individual
fix commands specifies whether they make a contribution to the
potential energy.

<P><B>Default:</B>

<P>The option defaults are temp = ID defined by fix, press = ID defined
by fix, energy = no.
