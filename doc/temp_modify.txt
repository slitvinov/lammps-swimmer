temp_modify command :h3

[Syntax:]

temp_modify temp-ID keyword value ... :pre

temp-ID = ID of temperature to modify :ulb,l
one or more keyword/value pairs may be listed :l
keyword = {extra} or {dynamic} :l
  {extra} value = N
    N = # of extra degrees of freedom to subtract
  {dynamic} value = {yes} or {no}
    yes/no = do or do not recompute the number of atoms contributing to the temperature :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

temp_modify mine extra 0
temp_modify mine dynamic yes :pre

[Description:]

Modify the parameters of a previously defined temperature method.
This can either be the default temperature defined by LAMMPS (ID =
{default}) or a user-defined temperature created by using the
"temperature"_temperature.html command.

The {extra} keyword refers to how many degrees-of-freedom are
subtracted (typically from 3N) as a normalizing factor in the
temperature computation.  The default is 3 which is a correction
factor for an ensemble of velocities with zero total linear momentum.

The {dynamic} keyword determines whether the number of atoms N in the
temperature group is re-computed each time the temperature is
computed.  By default, N is assumed to be constant.  If you are adding
atoms to the system (see the "fix pour"_fix_pour.html or "fix
deposit"_fix_deposit.html commands) or expect atoms to be lost
(e.g. due to evaporation), then this option can be used to insure the
temperature is correctly normalized.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:]

"temperature"_temperature.html

[Default:]

The option defaults are extra = 3 and dynamic = no.
