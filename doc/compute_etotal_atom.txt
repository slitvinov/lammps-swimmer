compute etotal/atom command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID etotal/atom compute-ID :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
etotal/atom = style name of this compute command
compute-ID = ID of compute that calculates per-atom pairwise energy :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 all etotal/atom atomEng :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that computes the total energy (kinetic +
pairwise) for each atom in a group.  This can be output via the "dump
custom"_dump.html command.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The per-atom total energy does NOT include
contributions due to bonds, angles, dihedrals, impropers that the atom
is part of, or a long-range Coulombic contribution.  The bond
contribution can be computed separately via the "compute
ebond/atom"_compute_ebond_atom.html command.  Currently, there is no
way in LAMMPS to calculate per-atom energy from angles, dihedrals,
improper, or long-range interactions.

The kinetic energy for each atom is computed the same way as in the
"compute ke/atom"_compute_ke_atom.html command, namely as 1/2 m v^2.

The pairwise energy for each atom is computed the same way as in the
"compute epair/atom"_compute_epair_atom.html command.  In fact, the
last argument to this command is the ID of the epair/atom compute that
performs this calculation.

[Restrictions:]

Some pair potentials do not allow the calculation of per-atom energy
and via the auxiliary "compute epair/atom"_compute_epair_atom.html
compute that is an argument to this command.
