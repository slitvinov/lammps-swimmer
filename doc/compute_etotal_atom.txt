compute etotal/atom command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID etotal/atom compute-ID :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
etotal/atom = style name of this compute command
compute-ID = ID of compute that calculates per-atom pairwise energy :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 all etotal/atom atomEng :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that computes the total energy (kinetic +
pairwise) for each atom in a group.  This can be output via the "dump
custom"_dump.html command.

The kinetic energy for each atom is computed the same way as in the
"compute ke/atom"_compute_ke_atom.html command, namely as 1/2 m v^2.

The pairwise energy is not calculated by this compute, but rather by
the "epair/atom compute"_compute_epair_atom.html specified as the last
argument of the command.

Note that the total energy per atom as defined here does not include
contributions due to bonds, angles, etc that the atom is part of.

[Restrictions:] none

[Default:] none
