<H3>fix nve/sphere command

<P><B>Syntax:</B>

<PRE>fix ID group-ID nve/sphere 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID, group-ID are documented in <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> command 

<LI>nve/sphere = style name of this fix command 

<LI>zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended

<PRE>  <I>update</I> value = <I>dipole</I>
    dipole = update orientation of dipole moment during integration

</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Perform constant NVE updates of position, velocity, and angular
velocity for spherical particles in the group each timestep.  V is
volume; E is energy.  This creates a system trajectory consistent with
the microcanonical ensemble.
</P>
<P>This fix differs from the <A HREF = "fix_nve.html">fix nve</A> command, which
assumes point particles and only updates their position and velocity.
</P>
<P>If the <I>update</I> keyword is used with the <I>dipole</I> value, then the
orientation of the dipole moment of each particle is also updated
during the time integration.  This option should be used for models
where a dipole moment is assigned to particles via the
<A HREF = "dipole.html">dipole</A> command.

<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.  None of the <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> options
are relevant to this fix.  No global scalar or vector or per-atom
quantities are stored by this fix for access by various <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#4_15">output
commands</A>.  No parameter of this fix can be
used with the <I>start/stop</I> keywords of the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command.
This fix is not invoked during <A HREF = "minimize.html">energy minimization</A>.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B> 
</P>
<P>This fix requires that particles be represented as extended spheres
and not point particles.  This means they will have an angular
velocity and a diameter which is determined either by the
<A HREF = "shape.html">shape</A> command or by each particle being assigned an
individual radius, e.g. for <A HREF = "atom_style.html">atom_style granular</A>.
