compute ackland/atom command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID ackland/atom :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
ackland/atom = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 all ackland/atom :pre

[Description:]

Defines a computation that calculates the local lattice structure
according to "(Ackland)"_#Ackland.

In contrast to the "centro-symmetry
parameter"_compute_centro_atom.html this method is stable against
temperature boost, because it is based not on the distance between
particles but the angles.  Therefore statistical fluctuations are
averaged out a little more.  A comparison with the Common Neighbor
Analysis metric is made in the paper..

The result is a number which is mapped to the following different
lattice structures:

1 = UNKNOWN
2 = BCC
3 = FCC
4 = HCP
5 = ICO :ul

The neighbor list needed to compute this quantity is constructed each
time the calculation is performed (i.e. each time a snapshot of atoms
is dumped).  Thus it can be inefficient to compute/dump this quantity
too frequently or to have multiple compute/dump commands, each of
which computes this quantity.-

[Restrictions:] none
