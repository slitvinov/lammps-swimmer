<H3>reset_timestep command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>reset_timestep N 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>N = timestep number 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>reset_timestep 0
reset_timestep 4000000 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Set the timestep counter to the specified value.  This command
normally comes after the timestep has been set by reading it in from a
file or a previous simulation advanced the timestep.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> and <A HREF = "create_box.html">create_box</A>
commands set the timestep to 0; the <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A>
command sets the timestep to the value it had when the restart file
was written.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B> none
</P>
<P>This command cannot be used when a dump file is defined via the
<A HREF = "dump.html">dump</A> command and has already been written to.  It also
cannot be used when a <A HREF = "restart.html">restart frequency</A> has been set,
and a restart file has already been written.  This is because the
changed timestep can mess up the planned timestep for the next file
write.  See the <A HREF = "undump.html">undump</A> command or <A HREF = "restart.html">restart
0</A> command for info on how to turn off these definitions
if necessary.  New specifications for dump and restart files can be
given after the reset_timestep command is used.
