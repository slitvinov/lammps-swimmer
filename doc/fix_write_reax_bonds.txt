fix write/reax/bonds command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID write/reax/bonds Nevery filename :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
write/reax/bonds = style name of this fix command :l
Nevery = output interval in timesteps :l
filename = naem of output file

[Examples:]

fix 1 all write/reax/bonds 100 bonds.tatb

[Description:]

Write out the bond information computed by the 
ReaxFF potential ("pair_style reax"_pair_reax.html).
During dynamics runs, the bond information is written 
to {filename} on timesteps that are multiples of 
{Nevery}, including timestep 0. No output is generated 
during minimization runs.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  None of the "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html options
are relevant to this fix. This fix does not provide any compute
quantities.

[Restrictions:]

This fix requires that the "pair_style reax"_pair_reax.html be invoked.
This fix is part of the "reax" package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package, which also requires the REAX
library be built and linked with LAMMPS.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#2_3 section for more info.
