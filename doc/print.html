<H3>print command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>print args 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>args = a line of text and variables names to print out 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>print The system volume is now $v 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Print the list of arguments as a line of text to the screen and/or
logfile.  If variables are included in the arguments, they will be
evaluated and their current values printed.  Note that if variables
are included, the print string should not be enclosed in double
quotes, else it will prevent the variables from being evaluated.
</P>
<P>If you want the print command to be executed multiple times (with
changing variable values), there are 3 options.  First, consider using
the <A HREF = "fix_print.html">fix print</A> command, which will invoke a print
periodically during a simulation.  Second, the print command can be
used as an argument to the <I>every</I> option of the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A>
command.  Third, the print command could appear in a section of the
input script that is looped over (see the <A HREF = "jump.html">jump</A> command).
</P>
<P>See the <A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> command for a description of <I>equal</I>
style variables which are typically the most useful ones to use with
the print command.  Equal-style variables can calculate complex
formulas involving atom and group properties, mathematical operations,
other variables, etc.
