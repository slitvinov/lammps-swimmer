fix wall/reflect command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID wall/reflect face arg ... keyword value ... :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
wall/reflect = style name of this fix command :l
one or more face/arg pairs may be appended :l
face = {xlo} or {xhi} or {ylo} or {yhi} or {zlo} or {zhi} :l
  {xlo},{ylo},{zlo} arg = EDGE or constant or variable
    EDGE = current lo edge of simulation box
    constant = number like 0.0 or -30.0 (distance units)
    variable = "equal-style variable"_variable.html like v_x or v_wiggle
  {xhi},{yhi},{zhi} arg = EDGE or constant or variable
    EDGE = current hi edge of simulation box
    constant = number like 50.0 or 100.3 (distance units)
    variable = "equal-style variable"_variable.html like v_x or v_wiggle :pre
zero or more keyword/avlue pairs may be appended :l
keyword = {units} :l
  {units} value = {lattice} or {box}
    {lattice} = the geometry is defined in lattice units
    {box} = the geometry is defined in simulation box units :pre
:ule

fix xwalls all wall/reflect xlo EDGE xhi EDGE
fix walls all wall/reflect xlo 0.0 ylo 10.0 units box
fix top all wall/reflect zhi v_pressdown :pre

[Description:]

Bound the simulation with one or more walls which reflect particles
in the specified group when they attempt to move thru them. 

Reflection means that if an atom moves outside the wall on a timestep
by a distance delta (e.g. due to "fix nve"_fix_nve.html), then it is
put back inside the face by the same delta, and the sign of the
corresponding component of its velocity is flipped.

When used in conjunction with "fix nve"_fix_nve.html and "run_style
verlet"_run_style.html, the resultant time-integration algorithm is
equivalent to the primitive splitting algorithm (PSA) described by
"Bond"_#Bond.  Because each reflection event divides
the corresponding timestep asymmetrically, energy conservation is only
satisfied to O(dt), rather than to O(dt^2) as it would be for
velocity-Verlet integration without reflective walls.

Up to 6 walls or faces can be specified in a single command: {xlo},
{xhi}, {ylo}, {yhi}, {zlo}, {zhi}.  A {lo} face reflects particles
that move to a coordinate less than the face position, back in the
{hi} direction.  A {hi} face reflects particles that move to a
coordinate higher than the face position, back in the {lo} direction.

The position of each face can be specified in one of 3 ways: as the
EDGE of the simulation box, as a constant value, or as a variable.  If
EDGE is used, then the corresponding boundary of the current
simulation box is used.  If a numeric constant is specified then the
wall is placed at that position in the appropriate dimension (x, y, or
z).  In both the EDGE and constant cases, the wall will never move.
If the face position is specified with a variable name v_ID, then ID
should be the name of an "equal-style variable"_variable.html.  In
this case the variable is evaluated each timestep and the result
becomes the current position of the reflecting wall.  Equal-style
variables can specify formulas with various mathematical functions,
and include "thermo_style"_thermo_style.html command keywords for the
simulation box parameters and timestep and elapsed time.  Thus it is
easy to specify a time-dependent wall position.

The {units} keyword determines the meaning of the distance units used
to define a face position, but only when a numeric constant is used.
It is not relevant when EDGE or a variable is used to specify a face
position.

A {box} value selects standard distance units as defined by the
"units"_units.html command, e.g. Angstroms for units = real or metal.
A {lattice} value means the distance units are in lattice spacings.
The "lattice"_lattice.html command must have been previously used to
define the lattice spacings.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  None of the "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html options
are relevant to this fix.  No global or per-atom quantities are stored
by this fix for access by various "output
commands"_Section_howto.html#4_15.  No parameter of this fix can be
used with the {start/stop} keywords of the "run"_run.html command.
This fix is not invoked during "energy minimization"_minimize.html.

[Restrictions:]

Any dimension (xyz) that has a reflecting wall must be non-periodic.

A reflecting wall should not be used with rigid bodies such as those
defined by a "fix rigid" command.  This is because the wall/reflect
displaces atoms directly rather than exerts a force on them.  For
rigid bodies, use a soft wall instead, such as "fix
wall/lj93"_fix_wall.html.  LAMMPS will flag the use of a rigid
fix with fix wall/reflect with a warning, but will not generate an
error.
