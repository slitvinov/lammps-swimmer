fix wall/lj126 command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID wall/lj126 style coord epsilon sigma cutoff :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command
wall/lj126 = style name of this fix command
style = {xlo} or {xhi} or {ylo} or {yhi} or {zlo} or {zhi}
coord = position of wall
epsilon = Lennard-Jones epsilon for wall-particle interaction
sigma = Lennard-Jones sigma for wall-particle interaction
cutoff = distance from wall at which wall-particle interaction is cut off :ul

[Examples:]

fix wallhi all wall/lj126 xhi 10.0 1.0 1.0 1.12 :pre

[Description:]

Bound the simulation domain with a Lennard-Jones wall that encloses
the atoms.  The energy E of a wall-particle interactions is given by
the 12-6 potential

:c,image(Eqs/pair_lj.jpg)

where {r} is the distance from the particle to the wall {coord}, and
epsilon and sigma are the usual LJ parameters.  Rc is the cutoff value
specified in the command.  This interaction provides a harder, more
repulsive interaction with the wall than the softer 9-3 potential
provided by the "fix wall/lj93"_fix_wall_lj93.html command.

The wall potential is shifted so that the energy of a wall-particle
interaction is 0.0 at the cutoff distance.

This fix supports the "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html options for
{thermo} and {energy}.  The former will print the contribution the fix
makes to the energy of the system when thermodynamics is printed,
where the energy of each particle comes from the integrated form of
the equation above.  The latter will add this contribution to the
total potential energy (PotEng).

The forces due to this fix are also imposed during an energy
minimization, invoked by the "minimize"_minimize.html command.  If you
want that energy to be included in the total potential energy of the
system (the quantity being minimized), you must enable the
"fix_modify"_fix_modify.html {energy} option for this fix.
