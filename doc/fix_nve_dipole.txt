fix nve/dipole command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID nve/dipole :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command
nve/dipole = style name of this fix command :ul

[Examples:]

fix 1 all nve/dipole :pre

[Description:]

Perform constant NVE updates of position, velocity, orientation, and
angular velocity for particles with point dipole moments in the group
each timestep.  V is volume; E is energy.  This creates a system
trajectory consistent with the microcanonical ensemble.
