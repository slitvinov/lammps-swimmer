fix nve/gran command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID nve/gran :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command
nve/gran = style name of this fix command :ul

[Examples:]

fix 1 all nve/gran :pre

[Description:]

Perform constant NVE updates each timestep on a group of atoms of atom
style granular.  V is volume; E is energy.  Granular atoms store
rotational information as well as position and velocity, so this
integrator updates translational and rotational degrees of freedom due
to forces and torques.
