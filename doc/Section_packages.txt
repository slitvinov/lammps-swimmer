4. Packages :h3

LAMMPS includes many optional packages, which are groups of files that
enable a specific set of features.  For example, force fields for
molecular systems or granular systems are in packages.  You can see
the list of all packages by typing "make package" from within the src
directory of the LAMMPS distribution.

See "this section"_Section_start.html#start_3 of the manual for
details on how to include/exclude specific packages as part of the
LAMMPS build process, and for more details about the differences
between standard packages and user packages in LAMMPS.

Below, the packages currently availabe in LAMMPS are listed.  For
standard packages, just a one-line description is given.  For user
packages, more details are provided.
