pair_style reax command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style reax hbcut precision :pre

hbcut = hydrogen-bond cutoff (distance units)
precision = precision for charge equilibration :ul

[Examples:]

pair_style reax
pair_style reax 10.0 1.0e-5
pair_coeff * * C H O N :pre

[Description:]

The pair style computes the ReaxFF potential of van Duin, Goddard and
co-workers.  ReaxFF uses distance-dependent bond-order functions to
represent the contributions of chemical bonding to the potential
energy.  Details of the interatomic potential energy calculation are
given in the following publications: "(van Duin 2001)"_#van_Duin_2001
and "(van Duin 2003)"_#van_Duin_2003.

Parameters for the elements C, H, O, N, S, and Si are given in the
parameter file ffield.reax in the potentials directory.  For other
elements, or for specific chemical systems, other parameter files may be
available elsewhere. The format of the parameter file is assumed to be
indentical to that used by van Duin and co-workers.

The hbcut and precision settings are optional arguments.  If neither
is provided, default settings of hbcut = 10 (Angstroms in real units)
and precision = 1.0e-6 (one part in 10^6) are used.  If you wish to
override either of these defaults, then both settings must be specified.

Use of this pair style requires that a charge be defined for every
atom.  See the "atom_style"_atom_style.html and
"read_data"_read_data.html commands for details.

The thermo variable {evdwl} stores the sum of all the ReaxFF potential
energy contributions, with the exception of the Coulombic and charge
equilibration contributions which are stored in the thermo variable
{ecoul}.  The output of these quantities is controlled by the
"thermo"_thermo.html command.

[Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info]:

This pair style does not support the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html
mix, shift, table, and tail options.

This pair style does not write its information to "binary restart
files"_restart.html, since it is stored in potential files.  Thus, you
need to re-specify the pair_style and pair_coeff commands in an input
script that reads a restart file.

This pair style can only be used via the {pair} keyword of the
"run_style respa"_run_style.html command.  It does not support the
{inner}, {middle}, {outer} keywords.

[Restrictions:]

This pair style is part of the "reax" package.  It is only enabled
if LAMMPS was built with that package.  See
the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#2_3 section for more info.

This pair potential ignores the "newton"_newton.html settings. Internally,
the newton setting is "on" for the force calculation, but "off" for
the neighbor list.

The ffield.reax potential file provided with LAMMPS (see the
potentials directory) is parameterized for real "units"_units.html.
You can use the ReaxFF potential with any LAMMPS units, but you would
need to create your own ffield.reax potential file with coefficients
listed in the appropriate units if your simulation doesn't use "real"
units.
