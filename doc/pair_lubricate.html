<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Styles <I>lubricate</I> and <I>lubricate/poly</I> compute hydrodynamic
interactions between mono-disperse spherical particles in a pairwise
fashion.  The interactions have 2 components.  The first is
Ball-Melrose lubrication terms via the formulas in <A HREF = "#Ball">(Ball and
Melrose)</A>
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/pair_lubricate.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>which represents the dissipation W between two nearby particles due to
their relative velocities in the presence of a background solvent with
viscosity mu.  Note that this is dynamic viscosity which has units of
mass/distance/time, not kinematic viscosity.
</P>
<P>The Asq (squeeze) term is the strongest and is always included.  It
scales as 1/gap where gap is the separation between the surfaces of
the 2 particles.  The Ash (shear) and Apu (pump) terms are only
include if <I>flaglog</I> is set to 1.  Thy are the next strongest
interactions, and the only other singular interaction, and scale as
log(gap).  The Atw (twist) term is currently not included.  It is
typically a very small contribution to the lubrication forces.
</P>
<P><I>Cutinner</I> sets the minimum center-to-center separation that will be
used in calculations irrespective of the actual separation.  <I>Cutoff</I>
is the maximum center-to-center separation at which an interaction is
computed.  Using a <I>cutoff</I> less than 3 radii is recommended if
<I>flaglog</I> is set to 1.
</P>
<P>The other component is due to the Fast Lubrication Dynamics (FLD)
approximation, described in <A HREF = "#Kumar">(Kumar)</A>, which can be
represented by the following equation
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/fld.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>where U represents the velocities and angular velocities of the
particles, U^<I>infty</I> represents the velocity and the angular velocity
of the undisturbed fluid, and E^<I>infty</I> represents the rate of strain
tensor of the undisturbed fluid with viscosity mu.  Again, note that
this is dynamic viscosity which has units of mass/distance/time, not
kinematic viscosity.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: When using the FLD terms, these pair styles are
designed to be used with explicit time integration and a
correspondingly small timestep.  Thus either <A HREF = "fix_nve_sphere.html">fix
nve/sphere</A> or <A HREF = "fix_nve_asphere.html">fix
nve/asphere</A> should be used for time integration.
To perform implicit FLD, see the <A HREF = "pair_lubricateU.html">pair_style
lubricateU</A> command.
</P>
<P>Style <I>lubricate</I> requires monodisperse spherical particles; style
<I>lubricate/poly</I> allows for polydisperse spherical particles.
</P>
<P>The viscosity mu can be varied in a time-dependent manner over the
course of a simluation, in which case in which case the pair_style
setting for mu will be overridden.  See the <A HREF = "fix_adapt.html">fix adapt</A>
command for details.
</P>
<P>If the suspension is sheared via the <A HREF = "fix_deform.html">fix deform</A>
command then the pair style uses the shear rate to adjust the
hydrodynamic interactions accordingly.
</P>
<P>Since lubrication forces are dissipative, it is usually desirable to
thermostat the system at a constant temperature.  If Brownian motion
(at a constant temperature) is desired, it can be set using the
<A HREF = "pair_brownian.html">pair_style brownian</A> command.  These pair styles
and the <I>brownian</I> style should use consistent parameters for <I>mu</I>,
<I>flaglog</I>, <I>flagfld</I>, <I>cutinner</I>, and <I>cutoff</I>.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atoms
types via the <A HREF = "pair_coeff.html">pair_coeff</A> command as in the examples
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
<A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> or <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A>
commands, or by mixing as described below:
</P>
<UL><LI>cutinner (distance units)
<LI>cutoff (distance units) 
</UL>
<P>The two coefficients are optional.  If neither is specified, the two
cutoffs specified in the pair_style command are used.  Otherwise both
must be specified.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Styles with a <I>cuda</I>, <I>gpu</I>, <I>omp</I>, or <I>opt</I> suffix are functionally 
the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.  They have 
been optimized to run faster, depending on your available hardware, 
as discussed in <A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">this section</A> of the manual.
The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should produce the
same results, except for round-off and precision issues.
</P>
<P>These accelerated styles are part of the USER-CUDA, GPU, USER-OMP and OPT
packages, respectively.  They are only enabled if LAMMPS was built with
those packages.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making LAMMPS</A>
section for more info.
</P>
<P>You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_6">-suffix command-line
switch</A> when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can
use the <A HREF = "suffix.html">suffix</A> command in your input script.
</P>
<P>See <A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">this section</A> of the manual for more
instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info</B>:
</P>
<P>For atom type pairs I,J and I != J, the two cutoff distances for this
pair style can be mixed.  The default mix value is <I>geometric</I>.  See
the "pair_modify" command for details.
</P>
<P>This pair style does not support the <A HREF = "pair_modify.html">pair_modify</A>
shift option for the energy of the pair interaction.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "pair_modify.html">pair_modify</A> table option is not relevant
for this pair style.
</P>
<P>This pair style does not support the <A HREF = "pair_modify.html">pair_modify</A>
tail option for adding long-range tail corrections to energy and
pressure.
</P>
<P>This pair style writes its information to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>, so pair_style and pair_coeff commands do not need
to be specified in an input script that reads a restart file.
</P>
<P>This pair style can only be used via the <I>pair</I> keyword of the
<A HREF = "run_style.html">run_style respa</A> command.  It does not support the
<I>inner</I>, <I>middle</I>, <I>outer</I> keywords.
</P>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>These styles are part of the FLD package.  They are only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info.
</P>
<P>Only spherical monodisperse particles are allowed for pair_style
lubricate.
