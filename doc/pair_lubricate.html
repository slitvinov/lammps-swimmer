<H3>pair_style lubricate command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>pair_style lubricate mu squeeze shear pump twist cutinner cutoff 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>mu = viscosity (mass/distance/time units)
<LI>squeeze = 0/1 for squeeze force off/on
<LI>shear = 0/1 for shear force off/on
<LI>pump = 0/1 for pump force off/on
<LI>twist = 0/1 for twist force off/on
<LI>cutinner = (distance units)
<LI>cutoff = outer cutoff for interactions (distance units) 
</UL>

<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Style <I>lubricate</I> computes pairwise interactions between mono-disperse
spherical particles via this formula from <A HREF = "#Ball">(Ball and Melrose)</A>
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/pair_lubricate.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>which represents the dissipation W between two nearby particles due to
the background solvent.  Rc is the outer cutoff specified in the
pair_style command, the translational velocities of the 2 particles
are v1 and v2, the angular velocities are w1 and w2, and n is the unit
vector in the direction from particle 1 to 2.  The 4 terms represent
four modes of pairwise interaction: squeezing, shearing, pumping, and
twisting.  The 4 flags in the pair_style command turn on or off each
of these modes by including or excluding each term.  The 4
coefficients on each term are functions of the separation distance of
the particles.  Details are given in <A HREF = "#Ball">(Ball and Melrose)</A>,
including the forces and torques that result from taking derivatives
of this equation (see Appendix A).
</P>
<P>Unlike most pair potentials, the two specified cutoffs (cutinner and
cutoff) refer to the surface-to-surface separation between two
particles, not center-to-center distance.  Currently, this pair style
can only be used for mono-disperse spheres (same radii), so that
separation is r_ij - 2*radius, where r_ij is the center-to-center
distance between the particles.  Within the inner cutoff <I>cutinner</I>,
the forces and torques are evaluated at a separation of cutinner.  The
outer <I>cutoff</I> is the separation distance beyond which the pair-wise
forces are zero.
</P>
<P>The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atoms
types via the <A HREF = "pair_coeff.html">pair_coeff</A> command as in the examples
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
<A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> or <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A>
commands, or by mixing as described below:
</P>
<UL><LI>cutinner (distance units)
<LI>cutoff (distance units) 
</UL>
<P>The two coefficients are optional.  If neither is specified, the two
cutoffs specified in the pair_style command are used.  Otherwise both
must be specified.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info</B>:
</P>
<P>For atom type pairs I,J and I != J, the two cutoff distances for this
pair style can be mixed.  The default mix value is <I>geometric</I>.  See
the "pair_modify" command for details.
</P>
<P>This pair style does not support the <A HREF = "pair_modify.html">pair_modify</A>
shift option for the energy of the pair interaction.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "pair_modify.html">pair_modify</A> table option is not relevant
for this pair style.
</P>
<P>This pair style does not support the <A HREF = "pair_modify.html">pair_modify</A>
tail option for adding long-range tail corrections to energy and
pressure.
</P>
<P>This pair style writes its information to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>, so pair_style and pair_coeff commands do not need
to be specified in an input script that reads a restart file.
</P>
<P>This pair style can only be used via the <I>pair</I> keyword of the
<A HREF = "run_style.html">run_style respa</A> command.  It does not support the
<I>inner</I>, <I>middle</I>, <I>outer</I> keywords.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This style is part of the "colloid" package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info.
</P>
<P>Because this poential computes forces and torques on particles, the
atom style must support particles whose size is set via the
<A HREF = "shape.html">shape</A> command.  This is <A HREF = "atom_style.html">atom_style</A>
ellipsoid and dipole.  Since only spherical mono-disperse particles
are currently allowed for pair_style lubricate, this means the 3 shape
radii for all particle types must be the same.
