suffix command :h3

[Syntax:]

suffix style :pre

style = {off} or {on} or {opt} or {gpu} or {cuda} :ul

[Examples:]

suffix off
suffix on
suffix gpu :pre

[Description:]

This command allows you to set a suffix which will
be added 

Use variants of various styles if they exist.  The specified style can
be {opt} or {gpu} or {cuda}.  These refer to optional packages that
LAMMPS can be built with, as described above in "Section 2.3"_#2_3.
The "opt" style corrsponds to the OPT package, the "gpu" style to the
GPU package, and the "cuda" style to the USER-CUDA package.

As an example, all of the packages provide a "pair_style
lj/cut"_pair_lj.html variant, with style names lj/cut/opt or
lj/cut/gpu or lj/cut/cuda.  Any variant styles can be specified
explicitly in your input script, e.g. pair_style lj/cut/gpu.  If the
-suffix switch is used, you do not need to modify your input script.
The specified suffix (opt,gpu,cuda) is automatically appended whenever
an input script command creates a new atom, pair, fix, compute, or
integrate style.  If the variant version does not exist, the standard
version is created.

The "suffix"_suffix.html command can also set the suffix.  It can also
turn off/on the suffix associated with this command-line switch.



Alter settings for use of accelerated versions of various styles.
LAMMPS can be built with optional packages which provide accelerated
versions of specific "atom"_atom_style.html, "pair"_pair_style.html,
"fix"_fix.html, "compute"_compute.html, and "integrate"_run_style.html
styles.

These are the relevant packages:

OPT = a handful of pair styles, cache-optimized for faster CPU performance
GPU = a handful of pair styles and the PPPM kspace_style, optimized to run on one or more GPUs or multicore CPU/GPU nodes
USER-CUDA = a collection of atom, pair, fix, compute, and intergrate styles, optimized to run on one or more NVIDIA GPUs :ul

See "this section"_Section_start.html#2_3 of the manual for
instructions on how to build LAMMPS with any of these packages.

These styles can be specified explicitly in your input script,
e.g. "pair_style lj/cut/gpu"_pair_lj.html.  If the -accelerator
command-line switch is used, you do not need to modify your input
script, as discussed in "this section"_Section_start.html#2_6 of the
manual.  The command-line suffix (opt,gpu,cuda) is automatically
appended when the style is created for atom, pair, fix, compute, and
integrate styles.  If an accelerated version does not exist, the
standard version is created.

If the -accelerator command-line switch is used, you may wish to
disable it for one or more input script commands, so that the standard
version of the style is used instead of the accelerated one.  This can
be useful for performance testing or debugging.

The {off} style allows you to do this.  The effect of the -accelerator
command-line switch is effectively turned off until another
accelerator command is used with the {on} style.
