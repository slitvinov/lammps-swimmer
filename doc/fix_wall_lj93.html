<UL><LI>ID, group-ID are documented in <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> command

<LI>style = <I>xlo</I> or <I>xhi</I> or <I>ylo</I> or <I>yhi</I> or <I>zlo</I> or <I>zhi</I>
<LI>coord = position of wall

<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Bound the simulation domain with a Lennard-Jones wall that encloses
the atoms.  The energy E of a wall-particle interactions is given by
the 9-3 potential
</P>

<P>where <I>r</I> is the distance from the particle to the wall <I>coord</I>, and
epsilon and sigma are the usual LJ parameters.  Rc is the cutoff value
specified in the command.  This interaction is derived by integrating
over a 3d half-lattice of Lennard-Jones 12-6 particles.  A harder,
more repulsive wall interaction can be computed by using the <A HREF = "fix_wall_lj126.html">fix
wall/lj126</A> command.
</P>
<P>The wall potential is shifted so that the energy of a wall-particle
interaction is 0.0 at the cutoff distance.

<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, thermo output, run start/stop, minimize info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> <I>energy</I> option is supported by this
fix to add the energy of interaction between atoms and the wall to the
system's potential energy as part of <A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermodynamic
output</A>.
</P>
<P>The atom/wall interaction energy can be printed as part of
thermodynamic output via the keyword f_ID, where ID is the fix-ID of
this fix.  See the <A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermo_style custom</A> command for
details.
</P>
<P>No parameter of this fix can be used with the <I>start/stop</I> keywords of
the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command.
</P>
<P>The forces due to this fix are imposed during an energy minimization,
invoked by the <A HREF = "minimize.html">minimize</A> command.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: If you want the atom/wall interaction energy to be
included in the total potential energy of the system (the quantity
being minimized), you MUST enable the <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A>
<I>energy</I> option for this fix.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>Any dimension (xyz) that has a LJ 9/3 wall must be non-periodic.
