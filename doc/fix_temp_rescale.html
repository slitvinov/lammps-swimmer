</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID, group-ID are documented in <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> command
<LI>temp/rescale = style name of this fix command
<LI>N = perform rescaling every N steps 
<LI>Tstart,Tstop = desired temperature at start/end of run (temperature units)
<LI>window = only rescale if temperature is outside this window (temperature units)
<LI>fraction = rescale to target temperature by this fraction
<LI>zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended
<LI>keyword = <I>region</I> or <I>partial</I>

<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Reset the temperature of a group of atoms by explicitly rescaling
their velocities.
</P>
<P>Rescaling is performed every N timesteps.  The target temperature is a
ramped value between the <I>Tstart</I> and <I>Tstop</I> temperatures at the
beginning and end of the run.
</P>
<P>Rescaling is only performed if the difference between the current and
desired temperatures is greater than the <I>window</I> value.  The amount
of rescaling that is applied is a <I>fraction</I> (from 0.0 to 1.0) of the
difference between the actual and desired temperature.  E.g. if
<I>fraction</I> = 1.0, the temperature is reset to exactly the desired
value.
</P>
<P>The keyword <I>region</I> applies the fix only to atoms that are in the
specified geometric region (and in the fix group).  Since atoms can
enter/leave a region, this test is performed each timestep.
</P>
<P>The keyword <I>partial</I> rescales only the specified velocity components.
A compute of style temp/partial is used to compute the current
temperature of just those components (see below).
</P>
<P>The <I>region</I> and <I>partial</I> keywords cannot currently be used together.
</P>
<P>A temp/rescale fix does not update the coordinates of its atoms.  It
is normally used with a fix of style <I>nve</I> that does that.  A
temp/rescale fix should not normally be used on atoms that also have
their temperature controlled by another fix - e.g. a
<A HREF = "fix_nvt.html">nvt</A> or <A HREF = "fix_langevin.html">langevin</A> fix.
</P>
<P>This fix computes a temperature each timestep.  To do this, the fix
creates its own compute of style "temp" or "temp/region" or
"temp/partial", as if one of these commands had been issued:
</P>
<PRE>compute fix-ID_temp group-ID temp
compute fix-ID_temp group-ID temp/region region-ID 
compute fix-ID_temp group-ID temp/partial xflag yflag zflag 
</PRE>
<P>Which is used depends on whether the <I>region</I> or <I>partial</I> keywords
were specified with the fix.  See the <A HREF = "compute_temp.html">compute
temp</A>, <A HREF = "compute_temp_region.html">compute
temp/region</A>, and <A HREF = "compute_temp_partial.html">compute
temp/partial</A> commands for details.  Note
that the ID of the new compute is the fix-ID + underscore + "temp",
and the group for the new compute is the same as the fix group.
</P>
<P>Note that this is NOT the compute used by thermodynamic output (see
the <A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermo_style</A> command) with ID = <I>thermo_temp</I>.
This means you can change the attributes of this fix's temperature
(e.g. its degrees-of-freedom) via the
<A HREF = "compute_modify.html">compute_modify</A> command or print this temperature
during thermodynamic output via the <A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermo_style
custom</A> command using the appropriate compute-ID.
It also means that changing attributes of <I>thermo_temp</I> will have no
effect on this fix.
</P>
<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> <I>temp</I> option is supported by this
fix.  You can use it to assign a <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> you have
defined to this fix which will be used in its thermostatting
procedure.  For consistency, if using the keyword <I>region</I>, the
compute you assign should also be of style
<A HREF = "compute_temp_region.html">temp/region</A>.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> <I>energy</I> option is supported by this
fix to add the energy change implied by a velocity rescaling to the
system's potential energy as part of <A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermodynamic
output</A>.  Note that because this fix is invoked
every N steps and thermodynamic info is printed every M steps, that
unless M is a multiple of N, the energy contribution will be zero.
</P>
<P>The potential energy change due to this fix is stored as a scalar
quantity, which can be accessed by various <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#4_15">output
commands</A>.  The scalar value calculated by
this fix is "extensive", meaning it scales with the number of atoms in
the simulation.
</P>
<P>The energy change can be printed as part of thermodynamic output via
the keyword f_ID, where ID is the fix-ID of this fix.  See the
<A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermo_style custom</A> command for details.
</P>
<P>This fix can ramp its target temperature over multiple runs, using the
<I>start</I> and <I>stop</I> keywords of the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command.  See the
<A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command for details of how to do this.
</P>
<P>This fix is not invoked during <A HREF = "minimize.html">energy minimization</A>.
