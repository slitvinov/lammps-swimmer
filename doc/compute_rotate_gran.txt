compute rotate/gran command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID rotate/gran :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
rotate/gran = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 all rotate/gran :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the total rotational energy of a
group of granular atoms.

The rotational energy is calculated as the sum of 1/2 I w^2 over all
the atoms in the group, where I is the moment of inertia of a
disk/spherical (2d/3d) particle, and w is its angular velocity.

[Output info:]

The scalar value calculated by this compute is "extensive", meaning it
it scales with the number of atoms in the simulation.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:] none

[Default:] none
