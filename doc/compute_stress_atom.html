<H3>compute stress/atom command

<UL><LI>ID, group-ID are documented in <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> command

<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a computation that computes the per-atom stress tensor for each
atom in a group.  The 6 components can be output via the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump
custom</A> command.
</P>
<P>The stress tensor is computed for only pairwise forces where the <I>ab</I>
component of stress on atom <I>i</I> is given by

<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/stress_tensor.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>where the first term is a kinetic energy component for atom <I>i</I>, <I>j</I>
loops over the <I>N</I> neighbors of atom <I>i</I>, and <I>Fb</I> is one of 3
components of force on atom <I>i</I> due to atom <I>j</I>.  Both <I>a</I> and <I>b</I>
take on values x,y,z to generate the 6 components of the symmetric
tensor.
</P>
<P>Note that this formula for stress does not include virial
contributions from intra-molecular interactions (e.g. bonds, angles,
torsions, etc).  Also note that this quantity is the negative of the
per-atom pressure tensor.  It is also really a stress-volume
formulation.  It would need to be divided by a per-atom volume to have
units of stress, but an individual atom's volume is not easy to
compute in a deformed solid.  Thus, if you sum the diagonal components
of the per-atom stress tensor for all atoms in the system and divide
the sum by 3V, where V is the volume of the system, you should get -P,
where P is the total pressure of the system.
</P>
<P>Computation of per-atom stress tensor components requires a loop thru
the neighbor list and inter-processor communication, so it can be
inefficient to compute/dump this quantity too frequently or to have
multiple compute/dump commands, each of a <I>stress/atom</I> style.
