<H3>mass command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>mass I value 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>I = atom type (see asterisk form below)
<LI>value = mass 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>mass 1 1.0
mass * 62.5
mass 2* 62.5 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Set the mass for all atoms of one or more atom types.  Mass values can
also be set in the <A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> data file.  See the
<A HREF = "units.html">units</A> command for what mass units to use.
</P>
<P>Most atom styles require masses to be specified.  One exception is
<A HREF = "atom_style.html">atom_style granular</A>, where masses are defined for
individual atoms, not types.  <A HREF = "pair_eam.html">Pair_style eam</A> defines
the masses of atom types in the EAM potential file.
</P>
<P>I can be specified in one of two ways.  An explicit numeric value can
be used, as in the 1st example above.  Or a wild-card asterisk can be
used to set the mass for multiple atom types.  This takes the form "*"
or "*n" or "n*" or "m*n".  If N = the number of atom types, then an
asterisk with no numeric values means all types from 1 to N.  A leading
asterisk means all types from 1 to n (inclusive).  A trailing asterisk
means all types from n to N (inclusive).  A middle asterisk means all
types from m to n (inclusive).
</P>
<P>A line in a data file that specifies mass uses the same format as the
arguments of the mass command in an input script, except that no
wild-card asterisk can be used.  For example, under the "Masses"
section of a data file, the line that corresponds to the 1st example
above would be listed as
</P>
<PRE>1 1.0 
</PRE>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This command must come after the simulation box is defined by a
<A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A>, <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A>, or
<A HREF = "create_box.html">create_box</A> command.
</P>
<P>All masses must be defined before a simulation is run (if the atom
style requires masses be set).  They must also all be defined before a
<A HREF = "velocity.html">velocity</A> or <A HREF = "fix_shake.html">fix shake</A> command is
used.
