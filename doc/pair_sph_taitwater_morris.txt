pair_style sph/taitwater/morris command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style sph/taitwater/morris :pre

[Examples:]

pair_style sph/taitwater/morris
pair_coeff * * 1000.0 1430.0 1.0 2.4

[Description:]

The sph/taitwater/morris style computes pressure forces between particles according to Tait's equation of state,
\begin{equation}
p = B [(\frac{\rho}{\rho_0})^{\gamma} - 1],
\end{equation}
where $\gamma=7$ and $B=c_0^2 \rho_0 / \gamma$, with $\rho_0$ being the reference density and $c_0$ the reference speed of sound.
This pair style also computes laminar viscosity (Morris1997).


The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atoms
types via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command as in the examples
above.

rho0 reference density (mass/volume units)
c0 reference soundspeed (distance/time units)
nu dynamic viscosity (mass*distance/time units)
h kernel function cutoff (distance units)

[Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info]:

These pair styles do not support mixing.  Thus, coefficients for all
I,J pairs must be specified explicitly. Additionally, because rho0 and c0 are defined on a per-type basis,
an I,I as well a J,J coefficients line must be specified prior to specifying an I,J interaction.

This style does not write information to "binary restart
files"_restart.html, so pair_style and pair_coeff commands do need
to be specified in an input script that reads a restart file.

These styles can only be used via the {pair} keyword of the "run_style
respa"_run_style.html command.  They do not support the {inner},
{middle}, {outer} keywords.

[Restrictions:]

The {pair sph/taitwater/morris} style is part of the "USER-SPH" package.  It is
only enabled if LAMMPS was built with that package (which it is by
default).  See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#2_3 section for
more info.
