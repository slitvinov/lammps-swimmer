<UL><LI>ID, group-ID are documented in <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> command

<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Enable a volume (density) change during a simulation.  Each of the 3
box dimensions is controlled separately.  Any dimension being varied
by this command must be periodic - see the <A HREF = "boundary.html">boundary</A>
command.  Dimensions not varied by this command can be periodic or
non-periodic.  The volume associated with an unspecified dimension can
also be controlled by a <A HREF = "fix_npt.html">fix npt</A> or <A HREF = "fix_nph.html">fix
nph</A> command.
</P>
<P>The initial simulation box boundaries at the beginning of a run are
specified by the <A HREF = "create_box.html">create_box</A> or
<A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> or <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A> command
used to setup the simulation, or they are the values at the end of the
previous run.  The desired simulation box boundaries at the end of the
run are given by the <I>lo</I> and <I>hi</I> arguments.  See the
<A HREF = "units.html">units</A> command for a discussion of distance units.
</P>
<P>Every Nth timestep during the run, the simulation box is expanded or
contracted to a ramped value between the initial and final values.
The <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command documents how to make the ramping take
place across multiple runs.  The coordinates of all atoms in the group
are also scaled to the new box size.
