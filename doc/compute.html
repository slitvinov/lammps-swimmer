<H3>compute command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>compute ID group-ID style args 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID = user-assigned name for the computation
<LI>group-ID = ID of the group of atoms to perform the computation on
<LI>style = one of a list of possible style names (see below)
<LI>args = arguments used by a particular style 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>compute 1 all temp

compute 3 all ke/atom 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Create a computation that will be performed on a group of atoms.
</P>
<P>In LAMMPS, a "compute" is used in several ways.  There are two kinds
of computes, "global" computes that calculate one or more values for
the entire group of atoms, and "per-atom" computes that calculate one
or more values for each atom in the group.  The latter has the word
"atom" in its style name.
</P>
<P>The results of global computes can be output via the <A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermo_style
custom</A> or <A HREF = "fix_ave_time.html">fix ave/time</A> command.
Or the values can be referenced in a <A HREF = "variable.html">variable equal</A>
command.  The results of computes that calculate a global temperature
or pressure can be used by fixes that do thermostatting or
barostatting and when atom velocities are created.
</P>
<P>The results of per-atom computes can be output via the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump
custom</A> command or the <A HREF = "fix_ave_spatial.html">fix
ave/spatial</A> command.  Or the per-atom values can
be time-averaged via the <A HREF = "fix_ave_atom.html">fix ave/atom</A> command and
then output via the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump custom</A> or <A HREF = "fix_ave_spatial.html">fix
ave/spatial</A> commands.
</P>
<P>See this <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#4_15">howto section</A> for a summary of
various LAMMPS output options.
</P>
<P>LAMMPS creates its own global computes for thermodynamic output.  Two
computes are always created, named "thermo_temp" and
"thermo_pressure", as if these commands had been invoked:
</P>
<PRE>compute thermo_temp all temp
compute thermo_pressure all pressure thermo_temp 
</PRE>
<P>Additional computes are created if the thermo style requires it.  See
the documentation for the <A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermo_style</A> command.
</P>
<P>The dumping of atom snapshots and fixes that compute temperature or
pressure also create computes as required.  These are discussed in the
documentation for the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump custom</A> and specific
<A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> commands.
</P>
<P>In all these cases, the default computes can be replaced by computes
defined by the user in the input script, as described by the
<A HREF = "thermo_modify.html">thermo_modify</A>, <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix modify</A>, and
<A HREF = "dump.html">dump</A> commands.
</P>
<P>Properties of either a default of user-defined compute can be modified
via the <A HREF = "compute_modify.html">compute_modify</A> command.
</P>
<P>Computes can be deleted with the <A HREF = "uncompute.html">uncompute</A> command.
</P>
<P>Code for new computes can be added to LAMMPS (see <A HREF = "Section_modify.html">this
section</A> of the manaul) and the results of their
calculations accessed in the various ways described above.
</P>
<P>Each compute style has its own doc page which describes its arguments
and what it does.  Here is an alphabetic list of compute styles
defined in LAMMPS:
