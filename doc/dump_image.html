<P><B>Examples:</B>

<PRE>dump myDump all image 100 dump.*.jpg 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Dump an image (picture) of the atom configuration every N timesteps as
either a JPG or PPM file.  A series of such images can easily be
converted into an animated movie of your simulation; see further
details below.  Other dump styles store snapshots of atom quantities
in various formats, as discussed on the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump</A> doc page.
</P>
<P>Only atoms in the specified group are rendered in the image.  The
<A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify region and thresh</A> commands can also
alter what atoms are included in the image.
</P>
<P>The filename suffix determines whether a JPG or PPM file is created.
If the suffix is ".jpg" or ".jpeg", then a JPG file is created, else a
PPM file is created.  To write out JPG files, you must build LAMMPS
with a JPEG library.  See <A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_2_4">this section</A> of
the manual for instructions on how to do this.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: Because periodic boundary conditions are enforced only
on timesteps when neighbor lists are rebuilt, the coordinates of an
atom image may be slightly outside the simulation box.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Dumps are performed on timesteps that are a multiple of N (including
timestep 0) and on the last timestep of a minimization if the
minimization converges.  Note that this means a dump will not be
performed on the initial timestep after the dump command is invoked,
if the current timestep is not a multiple of N.  This behavior can be
changed via the <A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify first</A> command, which
can be useful if the dump command is invoked after a minimization
ended on an arbitrary timestep.  N can be changed between runs by
using the <A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify every</A> command (not allowed
for <I>dcd</I> style).
</P>
<P>Dump image filenames must contain a wildcard character "*".  If a "*"
character appears in the filename, then one file per snapshot is
written and the "*" character is replaced with the timestep value.
For example, tmp.dump.*.jpg becomes tmp.dump.0.jpg,
tmp.dump.10000.jpg, tmp.dump.20000.jpg, etc.  Note that the
<A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify pad</A> command can be used to insure all
timestep numbers are the same length (e.g. 00010), which can make it
easier to convert a series of images into a movie in the correct
ordering.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The kewords listed above control how the image is rendered.  As listed
below, all of the keywords have defaults, most of which you will
likely not need to change.  The <A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump modify</A> also
has options specific to the dump image style, particularly for
assigning colors to atoms, bonds, and other image features.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>atom</I> keyword determines the color and size of atoms rendered in
the image.  If <I>none</I> is specified for the color value (with any diam
value), then no atoms are drawn.
</P>
<P>The color value can be <I>type</I> or <I>element</I> or an atom-attribute.
</P>
<P>If <I>type</I> is specified for the color
value, then the color of each atom is determined by its atom type.
By default the mapping of types to colors is as follows:
</P>
<UL><LI>type 1 = red
<LI>type 2 = green
<LI>type 3 = blue
<LI>type 4 = yellow
<LI>type 5 = aqua
<LI>type 6 = cyan 
</UL>
<P>and repeats itself for types > 6.  This mapping can be changed by the
<A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify acolor</A> command.
</P>
<P>If <I>element</I> is specified for the color value, then the color of each
atom is determined by which element it is, which in turn is specified
by the element-to-type mapping specified by the "dump_modify element"
command.  By default every atom type is C (carbon).  Every element has
a color associated with it, which is the same as used by the
<A HREF = "http://mt.seas.upenn.edu/Archive/Graphics/A">AtomEye</A> visualization package.
</P>


<P>An atom-attribute can also be used for the color value.  Any attribute
listed on the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump custom</A> doc page can be used, e.g. vx,
fy, q, spin, etc.  This includes per-atom quantities calculated by a
<A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A>, <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A>, or <A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A>.
For example, if "vx" is used as the per-atom attribute, then the color
of the atom will depend on the x-component of its velocity.
</P>
<P>The association of a per-atom value with a specific color is
determined by a "color map", which can be specified via the
<A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify</A> command.  The basic idea is that the
atom-attribute will be within a range of values, and every value
within the range is mapped to a specific color.  Depending on how the
color map is defined, that mapping can take place via interpolation so
that a value of -3.2 is halfway between "red" and "blue", or
discretely so that the value of -3.2 is "orange".
</P>
<P>The diam value can be a numeric value <I>D</I> or <I>type</I> or <I>element</I> or
<I>radius</I> or <I>shape</I> or an atom-attribute.
</P>
<P>If a numeric value <I>D</I> is specified, then all atoms will be drawn with
that diameter, e.g. 1.5, which is in distance units in whatever
<A HREF = "units.html">units</A> you are using, e.g. Angstroms.
</P>
<P>If <I>type</I> is specified for the diam value then the color of each atom
is determined by its atom type.  By default all types have diameter
1.0.  This mapping can be changed by the <A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify
adiam</A> command.
</P>
<P>If <I>element</I> is specified for the diam value, then the diamater of
each atom is determined by which element it is, which in turn is
specified by the element-to-type mapping specified by the "dump_modify
element" command.  By default every atom type is C (carbon).  Every
element has a diamtere associated with it, which is the same as used
by the <A HREF = "http://mt.seas.upenn.edu/Archive/Graphics/A">AtomEye</A> visualization package.
</P>
<P>If <I>radius</I> or <I>shape</I> is specified for the diam value then those the
atom style you are using must define those attributes.  The radius or
shape of the individual atom is then used to draw it.  Currently, only
spherical shapes are allowed.  Support for ellipsoids will be added
later.
</P>
<P>An atom-attribute can also be used for the diam value.  Any attribute
listed on the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump custom</A> doc page can be used, e.g. vx,
fy, q, spin, etc.  This includes per-atom quantities calculated by a
<A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A>, <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A>, or <A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A>.
For example, if "vx" is used as the per-atom attribute, then the
diameter of the atom will depend on the x-component of its velocity,
which will assumed to be >= 0.0, else the atom will not be drawn.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>bond</I> keyword determines the color and thickness or diameter of
bonds rendered in the image.  If <I>none</I> is specified for the color
value (with any diam value), then no bonds are drawn.
</P>
<P>If <I>atom</I> is specified for the color value, then the each bond is
drawn in 2 halves, with the color of each half being the color of the
atom at that end of the bond.
</P>
<P>If <I>type</I> is specified for the color value, then the color of each
bond is determined by its bond type.  By default the mapping of types
to colors is as follows:
</P>
<UL><LI>type 1 = red
<LI>type 2 = green
<LI>type 3 = blue
<LI>type 4 = yellow
<LI>type 5 = aqua
<LI>type 6 = cyan 
</UL>
<P>and repeats itself for types > 6.  This mapping can be changed by the
<A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify bcolor</A> command.
</P>
<P>The diam value can be a numeric value <I>D</I> or <I>type</I>.
</P>
<P>If a numeric value <I>D</I> is specified, then all bond will be drawn with
that diameter, e.g. 1.0, which is in distance units in whatever
<A HREF = "units.html">units</A> you are using, e.g. Angstroms.
</P>
<P>If <I>type</I> is specified for the diam value then the color of each bond
is determined by its bond type.  By default all types have diameter
0.5.  This mapping can be changed by the <A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify
bdiam</A> command.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>size</I> keyword determines the width and height of the created
image files, in numbers of pixels in each direction.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>view</I>, <I>center</I>, <I>up</I>, <I>zoom</I>, and <I>persp</I> settings determine how
3d simulation space is mapped to the 2d plane of the image.  Basically
they control how the simulation box appears in the image.
</P>
<P>All of the <I>view</I>, <I>center</I>, <I>up</I>, <I>zoom</I>, and <I>persp</I> settings can be
specified as numeric values, whose meaning is explained below.  But
any of them can also be specified as an equal-style variable, by using
v_name as the setting, where "name" is the variable name.  In this
case the variable will be evaluated on the timestep each image is
created to create a new setting.  If the equal-style variable is
time-dependent, this is a means of changing the way the simulation box
appears from image to image, effectively doing a pan or fly-by view of
your simulation.
</P>
<P>The <I>view</I> keyword determines the viewpoint from which the simulation
box is viewed.  The <I>theta</I> setting is the vertical angle from the +z
axis, and must be an angle from 0 to 180 degrees.  The <I>phi</I> setting
is an azimuthal angle around the z axis and can be positive or
negative.
</P>
<P>The <I>center</I> keyword determines the point in simulation space that
will be at the center of the image.  <I>Cx</I>, <I>Cy</I>, and <I>Cz</I> are
speficied as fractions of the box dimensions, so that (0.5,0.5,0.5) is
the center of the simulation box.  These values do not have to be
between 0.0 and 1.0, if you want the simulation box to be offset from
the center of the image.  Note, however, that if you choose odd values
for <I>Cx</I>, <I>Cy</I>, or <I>Cz</I> you may get a blank image.  Internally, <I>Cx</I>,
<I>Cy</I>, and <I>Cz</I> are converted into a point in simulation space.  If
<I>flag</I> is set to "s" for static, then this conversion is done once, at
the time the dump command is issued.  If <I>flag</I> is set to "d" for
dynamic then the conversion is performed every time a new image is
created.  If the box size or shape is changing, this will adjust the
center point in simulation space.
</P>
<P>The <I>up</I> keyword determines what direction in simulation space will be
"up" in the image.  Internally it is stored as a vector that is in the
plane perpendicular to the view vector implied by the <I>theta</I> and
<I>pni</I> settings, and which is in the plane defined by the view vector
and user-specified up vector.  Thus this internal vector is computed
from the user-specified <I>up</I> vector as
</P>
<PRE>up_internal = view cross (up cross view) 
</PRE>
<P>This means the only restriction on the specified <I>up</I> vector is that
it cannot be parallel to the <I>view</I> vector, implied by the <I>theta</I> and
<I>phi</I> settings.
</P>
<P>The <I>zoom</I> keyword scales the size of the simulation box as it appears
in the image.  The default <I>factor</I> setting of 1 should display an
image mostly filled by the atoms in the simulation box.  A <I>factor</I> >
1 will make the simulation box larger; a <I>factor</I> < 1 will make it
smaller.
</P>
<P>The <I>persp</I> keyword how much depth perspective is present in the
image.  Depth persepctive makes lines that are parallel in simulation
space appear non-parallel in the image.  A <I>factor</I> setting of 0.0
means that parallel lines will meet at infininty (1.0/factor), which
is an orthographic rendering with no persepctive.  A <I>factor</I> setting
between 0.0 and 1.0 will introduce more perspective.  A <I>factor</I> > 1
will create a highly skewed image with a large amount of perspective.
</P>
<P>The <I>dynamic</I> keyword 
determines the color and thickness of bonds
rendered in the image.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>box</I> keyword determines how the simulation box boundaries are
rendered as thin cylinders in the image.  If <I>no</I> is set, then the box
boundaries are not drawn and the <I>diam</I> setting is ignored.  If <I>yes</I>
is set, the 12 edges of the box are drawn, with a diameter that is a
fraction of the shortest box lenght in x, y, or z.  The color of the
box boundaires can be set with the <A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify
boxcolor</A> command.
</P>
<P>The <I>axes</I> keyword determines how the coordinate axes are rendered as
thin cylinders in the image.  If <I>no</I> is set, then the axes are not
drawn and the <I>length</I> and <I>diam</I> settings are ignored.  If <I>yes</I> is
set, 3 thin cylinders are drawn to represent the x,y,z axes in colors
red,green/blue.  The origin of these cylinders will be offset
from the lower left corner of the box by 10%.  The <I>length</I> setting
determines how long the cylinders will be.  The <I>diam</I> setting
determines their thickness.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>shiny</I> keyword determines how shiny the objects rendered in the
image will appear.  This must be a value 0.0 <= S <= 1.0, where S = 1
is a highly-reflective surface and S = 0 is a rough non-shiny surface.
</P>
<P>The <I>ssao</I> keyword turns on/off a screen space ambient occlusion
(SSAO) model for depth shading.  If <I>yes</I> is set, then atoms further
away from the viewer are darkened, which is perceived as depth by the
viewer.  The calculation of this effect can increase the cost of
computing the image by roughly 2x.  If <I>no</I> is set, the depth shading
is not performed.
</P>
<HR>
