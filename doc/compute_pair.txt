compute pair command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID pair pstyle :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
pair = style name of this compute command
pstyle = style name of a pair style that calculates additional values :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 all pair gauss
compute 1 all pair reax :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that extracts additional values calculated by a
pair style, sums them across processors, and makes them accessible for
output or further processing by other commands.  The group specified
for this command is ignored.

The specified {pstyle} must be a pair style that produces additional
values.  If a "hybrid pair style"_pair_hybrid.html is used, then
{pstyle} should be the name of a sub-style.

All pair styles tally a potential energy, which is accessed by the
"compute pe"_compute_pe.html and "compute
pe/atom"_compute_pe_atom.html commands.  Some pair styles tally one or
more additional values, such as a breakdown of the total pair
potential energy into sub-categories.  See the doc page for
"individual pair styles"_pair_style.html for info on these values.

The compute pair command lets you access this data as a global vector
of values and then use other "output options"_Section_howto.html#4_15
that work with "compute commands"_compute.html to see or use the
values.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a global vector of length >= 1, as determined
by the pair style.  These values can be used by any command that uses
global vector values from a compute as input.  See "this
section"_Section_howto.html#4_15 for an overview of LAMMPS output
options.

The vector values calculated by this compute are "extensive".  They
are in whatever units the pair style produces.

[Restrictions:] none
