<H3>compute erotate/sphere command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>compute ID group-ID erotate/sphere 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID, group-ID are documented in <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> command
<LI>erotate/sphere = style name of this compute command 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>compute 1 all erotate/sphere 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a computation that calculates the rotational kinetic energy of
a group of spherical particles.
</P>
<P>The rotational energy is computed as 1/2 I w^2, where I is the moment
of inertia for a sphere and w is the particle's angular velocity.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: For <A HREF = "dimension.html">2d models</A>, particles are treated
as spheres, not disks, meaning their moment of inertia will be the
same as in 3d.
</P>
<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>The scalar value calculated by this compute is "extensive", meaning it
it scales with the number of atoms in the simulation.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This compute requires that particles be represented as extended
spheres and not point particles.  This means they will have an angular
velocity and a diameter which is determined either by the
<A HREF = "shape.html">shape</A> command or by each particle being assigned an
individual radius, e.g. for <A HREF = "atom_style.html">atom_style granular</A>.
