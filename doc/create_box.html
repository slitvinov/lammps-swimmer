<H3>create_box command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>create_box N region-ID 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>N = # of atom types to use in this simulation
<LI>region-ID = ID of region to use as simulation domain 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>create_atoms 2 mybox 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command creates a simulation box based on the specified region.
Thus a <A HREF = "region.html">region</A> command must first be used to define a
geometric domain.
</P>
<P>The argument N is the number of atom types that will be used in the
simulation.
</P>
<P>If the region is not of style <I>prism</I>, then LAMMPS encloses the region
(block, sphere, etc) with an axis-aligned (orthogonal) box which
becomes the simulation domain.
</P>
<P>If the region is of style <I>prism</I>, LAMMPS creates a non-orthogonal
simulation domain shaped as a parallelepiped with triclinic symmetry.
See the <A HREF = "region.html">region prism</A> command for a description of how
the shape of the parallelepiped is defined.  The parallelepiped has
its "origin" at (xlo,ylo,zlo) and 3 edge vectors starting from its
origin given by a = (xhi-xlo,0,0); b = (xy,yhi-ylo,0); c =
(xz,yz,zhi-zlo).
</P>
<P>A prism region used with the create_box command must have skew factors
(xy,xz,yz) that do not skew the box more than half the distance of its
side lengths.  For example, if ylo = 2 and yhi = 12, then the y box
length is 10 and the xy factor must be between -5 and 5.  Similary xz
must be between -(zhi-zlo)/2 and +(zhi-zlo)/2 and yz must be between
-(zhi-zlo)/2 and +(zhi-zlo)/2.
</P>
<P>When a prism region is used, the simulation domain must be periodic in
any dimensions with a non-zero skew factor, as defined by the
<A HREF = "boundary.html">boundary</A> command.  I.e. if the xy factor is non-zero,
then both the x and y dimensions must be periodic.  Similarly, x and z
must be periodic if xz is non-zero and y and z must be periodic if yz
is non-zero.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>An <A HREF = "atom_style.html">atom_style</A> and <A HREF = "region.html">region</A> must have
been previously defined to use this command.
