<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>fix ID group gravity style args 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID, group are documented in <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> command 

<LI>gravity = style name of this fix command 

<LI>style = <I>chute</I> or <I>spherical</I> or <I>gradient</I> or <I>vector</I> 

<PRE>  <I>chute</I> args = angle
    angle = angle in +x away from -z axis (in degrees)

  <I>gradient</I> args = phi theta phi_grad theta_grad
    phi = azimuthal angle from +x axis (in degrees)
    theta = angle from +z axis (in degrees)
    phi_grad = rate of change of angle phi (full rotations per time unit)
    theta_grad = rate of change of angle theta
      (full rotations per time unit)
  <I>vector</I> args = magnitude x y z
    magnitude = size of acceleration (force/mass units)
    x y z = vector direction to apply the acceleration

<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>fix 1 all gravity chute 24.0
fix 1 all gravity spherical 0.0 -180.0
fix 1 all gravity gradient 0.0 -180.0 0.0 0.1
fix 1 all gravity vector 100.0 1 1 0 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Impose an additional acceleration on each particle in the group.  For
granular systems the magnitude is chosen so as to be due to gravity.
For non-granular systems the magnitude of the acceleration is
specified, so it can be any kind of driving field desired (e.g. a
pressure gradient inducing a Poisselle flow).  Note that this is
different from what the <A HREF = "fix_addforce.html">fix addforce</A> command does,
since it adds the same force to each atom, independent of its mass.
This command adds the same acceleration to each atom (force/mass).
</P>
<P>The first 3 styles apply to granular systems.  Style <I>chute</I> is
typically used for simulations of chute flow where the specified angle
is the chute angle, with flow occurring in the +x direction.  Style
<I>spherical</I> allows an arbitrary 3d direction to be specified for the
gravity vector.  Style <I>gradient</I> allows the direction of the gravity
vector to be time dependent.  The units of the gradient arguments are
in full rotations per time unit.  E.g. a timestep of 0.001 and a
gradient of 0.1 means the gravity vector would rotate thru 360 degrees
every 10,000 timesteps.  For the time-dependent case, the initial
direction of the gravity vector is phi,theta at the time the fix is
specified.
</P>
<P>Phi and theta are defined in the usual spherical coordinates.  Thus
for gravity acting in the -z direction, theta would be specified as
180.0 (or -180.0).  Theta = 90.0 and phi = -90.0 would mean gravity
acts in the -y direction.
</P>
<P>For the <I>chute</I>, <I>spherical</I>, and <I>gradient</I> styles, the strength of
the acceleration due to gravity is 1.0 in force/mass units.  These
styles are intended to be used with LJ <A HREF = "units.html">units</A> which is the
typical choice for granular systems in LAMMPS.
</P>
<P>Style <I>vector</I> can be used for non-granular systems.  An acceleration
of the specified magnitude in force/mass units is applied to each atom
in the group in the vector direction given by (x,y,z).

<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.  None of the <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> options
are relevant to this fix.  No quantities calculated by this fix can be
output by the <A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermo_style custom</A> command.  No
parameter of this fix can be used with the <I>start/stop</I> keywords of
the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command.  This fix is not invoked during <A HREF = "minimize.html">energy
minimization</A>.

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>Styles <I>chute</I>, <I>spherical</I>, and <I>gradient</I> can only be used with
atom_style granular.  Style <I>vector</I> can only be used with
non-granular systems.
