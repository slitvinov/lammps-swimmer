fix gran/diag command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID gran/diag nevery file zlayer :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command
gran/diag = style name of this fix command
nevery = compute diagnostics every this many timesteps
file = filename to store diagnostic info in
zlayer = bin size in z dimension :ul

[Examples:]

fix 1 all gran/diag 1000 tmp 0.9 :pre

[Description:]

Compute aggregate density, velocity, and stress diagnostics for a
group of granular atoms as a function of z depth in the granular
system.  The results are written to 3 files named file.den, file.vel,
and file.str.  The z bins begin at the bottom of the system and extend
upward with a thickness of {zlayer} for each bin.  The quantities
written to the file are averaged over all atoms in the bin.

[Restrictions:]

Can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the "granular" package.
