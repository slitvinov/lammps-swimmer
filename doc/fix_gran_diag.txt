fix gran/diag command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID gran/diag nevery file zlayer :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command
gran/diag = style name of this fix command
nevery = compute diagnostics every this many timesteps
file = filename to store diagnostic info in
zlayer = bin size in z dimension :ul

[Examples:]

fix 1 all gran/diag 1000 tmp 0.9 :pre

[Description:]

Compute aggregate density, velocity, and stress diagnostics for a
group of granular atoms as a function of z depth in the granular
system.  The results are written to 3 files named file.den, file.vel,
and file.str.  The z bins begin at the bottom of the system and extend
upward with a thickness of {zlayer} for each bin.  The quantities
written to the file are averaged over all atoms in the bin.

[Restart, fix_modify, thermo output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  None of the "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html options
are relevant to this fix.  No quantities calculated by this fix can be
output by the "thermo_style custom"_thermo_style.html command.  No
parameter of this fix can be used with the {start/stop} keywords of
the "run"_run.html command.  This fix is not invoked during "energy
minimization"_minimize.html.

[Restrictions:]

This fix is part of the "granular" package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#2_3 section for more info.

[Default:] none
