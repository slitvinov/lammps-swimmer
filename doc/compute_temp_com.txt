compute temp/com command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID temp/com :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
temp/com = style name of this compute command

[Examples:]

compute newT oxygen temp/com :pre

[Description:]

Define a compute to calculate the temperature of a group of atoms,
where the momentum of each atom includes that of atoms to which
it is directly bonded.  
A compute of this style can be used by any command that computes a temperature,
e.g. "thermo_modify"_thermo_modify.html, "fix
temp/rescale"_fix_temp_rescale.html, "fix npt"_fix_npt.html, etc.

The temperature is calculated by the formula KE = dim/2 N k T, where
KE = total kinetic energy of the group of atoms
The kinetic energy of each atom is based on the center of mass motion 
of itself and all the atoms directly bonded to it.
N = number of atoms in the
group, k = Boltzmann constant, and T = temperature. 
The dim parameter is adjusted to give the correct number of
degrees of freedom.

The number of atoms contributing to the temperature is assumed to be
constant for the duration of the run; use the {dynamic} option of the
"compute_modify"_compute_modify.html command if this is not the case.

This command can also be used to compute a vector of two quantities. The
first is the temperature described above; the second is the temperature
based on the complementary part of the kinetic energy i.e. it uses the
momentum of the atom and its directly-bonded neighbors, relative to their
 center of mass. It is scaled by the total number of atoms minus the total
number of group atoms.

This compute should only be used in cases where none of the atoms in the group
have any directly-bonded neighbors in common, including each other. 
If there are no directly-bonded
neighbors, then this compute is equivalent to "compute temp"

[Output info:]

All values calculated by this compute are "intensive", 
meaning they are independent of the number of atoms in the simulation.

[Restrictions:] none
