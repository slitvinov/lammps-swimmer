compute epair/atom command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID epair/atom :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
epair/atom = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 all epair/atom :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that computes the per-atom pairwise energy for
each atom in a group.  This can be output via the "dump
custom"_dump.html command.

The pairwise energy for each atom is computed by looping over its
neighbors and computing the energy associated with the defined
"pair_style"_pair_style.html command for each IJ pair (divided by 2).
Thus the sum of per-atom energy for all atoms should give the total
pairwise energy of the system.

For force fields that include a contribution to the pairwise energy
that is computed as part of dihedral terms (i.e. 1-4 interactions),
this contribution is not included in the per-atom pairwise energy.

Computation of per-atom pairwise energy requires a loop thru the
neighbor list and inter-processor communication, so it can be
inefficient to compute/dump this quantity too frequently or to have
multiple compute/dump commands, each of a {epair/atom} style.

[Restrictions:] none
