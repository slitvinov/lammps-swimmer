<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Set a fix that will be applied to a group of atoms.  In LAMMPS, a
"fix" is any operation that is applied to the system during
timestepping or minimization.  Examples include updating of atom
positions and velocities due to time integration, controlling
temperature, applying constraint forces to atoms, enforcing boundary
conditions, computing diagnostics, etc.  There are dozens of fixes
defined in LAMMPS and new ones can be added; see <A HREF = "Section_modify.html">this
section</A> for a discussion.
</P>
<P>Fixes perform their operations at different stages of the timestep.
If 2 or more fixes operate at the same stage of the timestep, they are
invoked in the order they were specified in the input script.
</P>
<P>The ID of a fix can only contain alphanumeric characters and
underscores.
</P>
<P>Fixes can be deleted with the <A HREF = "unfix.html">unfix</A> command.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: The <A HREF = "unfix.html">unfix</A> command is the only way to turn
off a fix; simply specifying a new fix with a similar style will not
turn off the first one.  This is especially important to realize for
integration fixes.  For example, using a <A HREF = "fix_nve.html">fix nve</A>
command for a second run after using a <A HREF = "fix_nvt.html">fix nvt</A> command
for the first run, will not cancel out the NVT time integration
invoked by the "fix nvt" command.  Thus two time integrators would be
in place!
</P>
<P>If you specify a new fix with the same ID and style as an existing
fix, the old fix is deleted and the new one is created (presumably
with new settings).  This is the same as if an "unfix" command were
first performed on the old fix, except that the new fix is kept in the
same order relative to the existing fixes as the old one originally
was.  Note that this operation also wipes out any additional changes
made to the old fix via the <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> command.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix modify</A> command allows settings for some
fixes to be reset.  See the doc page for individual fixes for details.
</P>
<P>Some fixes calculate a global scalar or vector quantity which can be
accessed by various commands for output, including <A HREF = "variable.html">equal- and
atom-style variables</A>, <A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermo_style
custom</A>, and <A HREF = "fix_ave_time.html">fix ave/time</A>.
</P>
<P>Some fixes calculate a per-atom scalar or vector quantity which can be
accessed by various commands for output, including <A HREF = "variable.html">atom-style
variables</A>, <A HREF = "dump.html">dump_style custom</A>, and <A HREF = "fix_ave_spatial.html">fix
ave/spatial</A>.
</P>
<P>The results of fixes that calculate global quantities can be either
"intensive" or "extensive" values.  Intensive means the value is
independent of the number of atoms in the simulation, e.g. timestep
size.  Extensive means the value scales with the number of atoms in
the simulation, e.g. total force applied by the fix.  <A HREF = "thermo_style.html">Thermodynamic
output</A> will normalize extensive values depending on
the "thermo_modify norm" setting.  But if a fix value is accessed in
another way, e.g. by a <A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A>, you may need to know
whether it is an intensive or extensive value.  See the doc page for
individual fixes for further info.
</P>
<P>See this <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#4_15">howto section</A> for a summary of
various LAMMPS output options.  See the doc pages for individual fixes
for info on which ones calculate these quantities.
</P>
<P>Some fixes store an internal "state" which is written to binary
restart files via the <A HREF = "restart.html">restart</A> or
<A HREF = "write_restart.html">write_restart</A> commands.  This allows the fix to
continue on with its calculations in a restarted simulation.  See the
<A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A> command for info on how to re-specify
a fix in an input script that reads a restart file.  See the doc pages
for individual fixes for info on which ones can be restarted.

<P>Some fix styles are part of specific packages.  They are only enabled
if LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info on packages.  The
doc pages for individual fixes tell if it is part of a package.
