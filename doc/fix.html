<H3>fix command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>fix ID group-ID style args 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID = user-assigned name for the fix
<LI>group-ID = ID of the group of atoms to apply the fix to
<LI>style = one of a long list of possible style names (see below)
<LI>args = arguments used by a particular style 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>fix 1 all nve
fix 3 all nvt 300.0 300.0 0.01
fix mine top setforce 0.0 NULL 0.0 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Set a fix that will be applied to a group of atoms.  In LAMMPS, a
"fix" is any operation that is applied to the system during
timestepping or minimization.  Examples include updating of atom
positions and velocities due to time integration, controlling
temperature, applying constraint forces to atoms, enforcing boundary
conditions, computing diagnostics, etc.  There are dozens of fixes
defined in LAMMPS and new ones can be added - see <A HREF = "Section_modify.html">this
section</A> for a discussion.
</P>
<P>Each fix style has its own documentation page which describes its
arguments and what it does, as listed below.
</P>
<P>Fixes perform their operations at different stages of the timestep.
If 2 or more fixes both operate at the same stage of the timestep,
they are invoked in the order they were specified in the input script.
</P>
<P>Fixes can be deleted with the <A HREF = "unfix.html">unfix</A> command.  Note that
this is the only way to turn off a fix; simply specifying a new fix
with a similar style will not turn off the first one.  For example,
using a <A HREF = "fix_nve.html">fix nve</A> command for a second run after using a
<A HREF = "fix_nvt.html">fix nvt</A> command for the first run, will not cancel out
the NVT time integration invoked by the "fix nvt" command.  Thus two
time integrators would be in place!
</P>
<P>If you specify a new fix with the same ID and style as an existing
fix, the old fix is deleted and the new one is created (presumably
with new settings).  This is the same as if an "unfix" command were
first performed on the old fix, except that the new fix is kept in the
same order relative to the existing fixes as the old one originally
was.  Note that this operation also wipes out any additional changes
made to the old fix via the <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> command.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix modify</A> command allows settings for some
fixes to be reset.  See the doc page for individual fixes for details.
</P>
<P>Some fixes store an internal "state" which is written to binary
restart files via the <A HREF = "restart.html">restart</A> or
<A HREF = "write_restart.html">write_restart</A> commands.  This allows the fix to
continue on with its calculations in a restarted simulation.  See the
<A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A> command for info on how to re-specify
a fix in an input script that reads a restart file.  See the doc pages
for individual fixes for info on which ones can be restarted.

included in the LAMMPS distribution.  The list of these with links to
the individual styles are given in the fix section of <A HREF = "Section_commands.html#3_5">this

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>

<P>Some fix styles are part of specific packages.  They are only enabled
if LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info on packages.  The
doc pages for individual fixes tell if it is part of a package.
