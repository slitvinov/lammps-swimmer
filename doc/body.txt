body particles :h3

[Description:]

This doc page is not about a specific LAMMPS input script command, but
about body particles, 


which are a specific kind of
"atom_style"_atom_style.html supported by LAMMPS



These are the body styles that LAMMPS currently supports.  The name in
the first column is used as the {bstyle} argument for atom_style body:

{nparticle} | body with N sub-particles :tb(c=2,s=|)

Of course, the interactions
between pairs of bodies will need to be encoded in an appropriate pair
style.

Body particles can represent complex entities,
such as surface meshes of discrete points, collections of
sub-particles, deformable objects, etc.




By contrast, the "fix rigid"_fix_rigid.html command constructs rigid
bodies out of multiple particles.  The particles can be point
particles or finite-size particles (spheres, ellipsoids, line
segments, triangles).  The particles in each rigid body interact with
each other in the usual pairwise fashion via whatever pair style is
defined.  The sum of these interactions determine the total force and
torque on each rigid body, which the "fix rigid"_fix_rigid.html
command then time integrates.

[Syntax:]

atom_style style args :pre

style = {angle} or {atomic} or {body} or {bond} or {charge} or {dipole} or \
        {electron} or {ellipsoid} or {full} or {line} or {meso} or \
	{molecular} or {peri} or {sphere} or {tri} or {hybrid} :ul
  args = none for any style except {body} and {hybrid}
  {body} args = bstyle
    bstyle = style of body particles
  {hybrid} args = list of one or more sub-styles, each with their args :pre

[Examples:]

atom_style atomic
atom_style bond
atom_style full
atom_style body nparticle 2 10
atom_style hybrid charge bond
atom_style hybrid charge body nparticle 2 5 :pre
