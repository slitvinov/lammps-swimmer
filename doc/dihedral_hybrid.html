<H3>dihedral_style hybrid command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>dihedral_style hybrid style1 style2 ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>style1,style2 = list of one or more dihedral styles 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>

<PRE>dihedral_style hybrid harmonic helix
dihedral_coeff 1 harmonic 6.0 1 3
dihedral_coeff 2 helix 10 10 10 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The <I>hybrid</I> style enables the use of multiple dihedral styles in one
simulation.  An dihedral style is assigned to each dihedral type.  For
example, dihedrals in a polymer flow (of dihedral type 1) could be
computed with a <I>harmonic</I> potential and dihedrals in the wall
boundary (of dihedral type 2) could be computed with a <I>helix</I>
potential.  The assignment of dihedral type to style is made via the
<A HREF = "dihedral_coeff.html">dihedral_coeff</A> command or in the data file.
</P>
<P>In the dihedral_coeff command, the first coefficient sets the dihedral
style and the remaining coefficients are those appropriate to that
style.  In the example above, the 2 dihedral_coeff commands set
dihedrals of dihedral type 1 to be computed with a <I>harmonic</I>
potential with coefficients 80.0, 1.2 for K, d, n.  Dihedral type 2
would be computed with a <I>helix</I> potential with coefficients 10.0,
10.0, 10.0 for A, B, C.
</P>
<P>If dihdral coefficients are specified in the data file read via the
<A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> command, then the same string,
e.g. "harmonic" or "helix", must be listed as the 1st argument of each
line in the "Dihedral Coeffs" section, e.g.
</P>
<PRE>1 harmonic 6.0 1 3 
</PRE>
<P>If the dihedral <I>class2</I> potential is one of the hybrid styles, the
same rules hold for specifying the additional MiddleBondTorsion,
EndBondTorsion, AngleTorsion, AngleAngleTorsion, and BondBond13
coefficients either via the input script or in the data file.
I.e. "class2" must be added in both cases before the "mbt" or "ebt" or
"at" or "aat" or "bb13" argument.
</P>
<P>A dihedral style of <I>none</I> can be specified as the 2nd argument to the
dihedral_coeff command or the 1st argument in the data file, if you
desire to turn off certain dihedral types.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This dihedral style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
"molecular" package (which it is by default).  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info on packages.
</P>
<P>Unlike other dihedral styles, the hybrid dihedral style does not store
dihedral coefficient info for individual sub-styles in a <A HREF = "restart.html">binary
restart files</A>.  Thus when retarting a simulation from a
restart file, you need to re-specify dihedral_coeff commands.
