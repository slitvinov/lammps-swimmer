pair_style colloid command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style colloid cutoff :pre

cutoff = global cutoff for colloidal interactions (distance units) :ul

[Examples:]

pair_style colloid 10.0
pair_coeff * *  25 1.0 10.0 10.0
pair_coeff 1 1 144 1.0 0.0 0.0 3.0
pair_coeff 1 2  75.398 1.0 0.0 10.0 9.0
pair_coeff 2 2  39.478 1.0 10.0 10.0 25.0 :pre

[Description:]

Style {colloid} computes pairwise interactions between large colloidal
particles and small solvent particles using 3 formulas.  A colloidal
particle has a size > sigma; a solvent particle is the usual
Lennard-Jones particle of size sigma.

The colloid-colloid interaction energy is given by

:c,image(Eqs/pair_colloid_cc.jpg)

A is the Hamaker constant, a1 and a2 are the radii of the two
colloidal particles, and Rc is the cutoff.  This equation results from
describing each colloidal particle as an integrated collection of
Lennard-Jones particles of size sigma and is derived in
"(Everaers)"_#Everaers.

The colloid-solvent interaction energy is given by

:c,image(Eqs/pair_colloid_cs.jpg)

A is the Hamaker constant, a is the radius of the colloidal particle,
and Rc is the cutoff.  This formula is derived from the
colloid-colloid interaction, letting one of the particle sizes go to
zero.

The solvent-solvent interaction energy is given by the usual
Lennard-Jones formula

:c,image(Eqs/pair_colloid_ss.jpg)

which results from letting both particle sizes go to zero.

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atoms
types via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command as in the examples
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
"read_data"_read_data.html or "read_restart"_read_restart.html
commands, or by mixing as described below:

A (energy units)
sigma (distance units)
d1 (distance units)
d2 (distance units)
cutoff (distance units) :ul

A is the energy prefactor and should typically be set as follows:

A_cc = colloid/colloid = 4 pi^2 = 39.5
A_ss = solvent/solvent = 144 (assuming epsilon = 1, so that 144/36 = 4)
A_cs = colloid/solvent = sqrt(A_cc*A_ss) :ul

Sigma is the size of the solvent particle or the constituent particles
integrated over in the colloidal particle and should typically be set
as follows:

Sigma_cc = colloid/colloid = 1.0
Sigma_ss = solvent/solvent = 1.0 or whatever size the solvent particle is
Sigma_cs = colloid/solvent = arithmetic mixing between colloid sigma and solvent sigma :ul

Thus typically Sigma_cs = 1.0, unless the solvent particle's size !=
1.0.

D1 and d2 are particle diameters, so that d1 = 2*a1 and d2 = 2*a2 in
the formulas above.  Both d1 and d2 must be values >= 0.  If d1 > 0
and d2 > 0, then the pair interacts via the colloid-colloid formula
above.  If d1 = 0 and d2 = 0, then the pair interacts via the
solvent-solvent formula.  I.e. a d value of 0 is a Lennard-Jones
particle of size sigma.  If either d1 = 0 or d2 = 0 and the other is
larger, then the pair interacts via the colloid-solvent formula.

Note that the diameter of a particular particle type may appear in
multiple pair_coeff commands, as it interacts with other particle
types.  You should insure the particle diameter is specified
consistently each time it appears.

The last coefficient is optional.  If not specified, the global cutoff
specified in the pair_style command is used.  However, you typically
want different cutoffs for interactions between different particle
sizes.  E.g. if colloidal particles of diameter 10 are used with
solvent particles of diameter 1, then a solvent-solvent cutoff of 2.5
would correspond to a colloid-colloid cutoff of 25.  A good
rule-of-thumb is to use a colloid-solvent cutoff that is half the big
diamter + 4 times the small diamter.  I.e. 9 = 5 + 4 for the
colloid-solvent cutoff in this case.

[Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, per-atom energy/stress, and
restart info]:

For atom type pairs I,J and I != J, the A, sigma, d1, and d2
coefficients and cutoff distance for this pair style can be mixed.  A
is an energy value mixed like a LJ epsilon.  D1 and d2 are distance
values and are mixed like sigma.  The default mix value is
{geometric}.  See the "pair_modify" command for details.

This pair style supports the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html shift
option for the energy of the pair interaction.

The "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html table option is not relevant
for this pair style.

This pair style does not support the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html
tail option for adding long-range tail corrections to energy and
pressure.

This pair style can calculate per-atom energy and stress, as used by
the "compute epair/atom"_compute_epair_atom.html, "compute
stress/atom"_compute_stress_atom.html, and "dump custom"_dump.html
commands.

This pair style writes its information to "binary restart
files"_restart.html, so pair_style and pair_coeff commands do not need
to be specified in an input script that reads a restart file.

[Restrictions:]

This style is part of the "colloid" package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#2_3 section for more info.

"pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html

[Default:] none
