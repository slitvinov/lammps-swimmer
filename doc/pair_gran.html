</PRE>
<UL><LI>style = <I>gran/hertzian</I> or <I>gran/history</I> or <I>gran/no_history</I> 

<LI>Kn = spring constant for particle repulsion (force/distance units) 

<LI>gamma_n = damping coefficient for normal direction collisions (1/time units) 

<LI>xmu = static yield criterion (unitless) 

<LI>dampflag = 0 or 1 if tangential damping force is excluded or included

<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The <I>gran</I> styles use the following formula <A HREF = "#Silbert">(Silbert)</A> for
frictional force between two granular particles that are a distance r
apart when r is less than the contact distance d = Ri + Rj, where Ri
and Rj are the radii of the two particles:
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/pair_granular.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>The 1st term is a normal force and the 2nd term is a tangential force.
The normal force has 2 parts: a contact force and a damping force.
The tangential force also has 2 parts: a shear force and a damping
force.  The shear force is included in pair styles <I>history</I> and
<I>Hertzian</I>, but is not included in pair style <I>no_history</I>.  The
tangential damping force is not included if <I>dampflag</I> is set to 0.
The other quantities in the equation are as follows:
</P>
<UL><LI>delta = d - r
<LI>f(x) = 1 for Hookean contact used in pair styles <I>history</I> and <I>no_history</I>
<LI>f(x) = sqrt(x) for Hertzian contact used in pair style <I>hertzian</I>
<LI>Kn = elastic constant for normal contact
<LI>Kt = elastic constant for tangential contact = 2/7 of Kn
<LI>gamma_n = viscoelastic damping constant for normal contact
<LI>gamma_t = viscoelastic damping constant for tangential contact = 1/2 of gamma_n
<LI>m_eff = Mi Mj / (Mi + Mj) = effective mass of 2 particles of mass Mi and Mj
<LI>Delta St = tangential displacement vector between the 2 spherical particles       which is truncated to satisfy a frictional yield criterion
<LI>n_ij = unit vector along the line connecting the centers of the 2 particles
<LI>Vn = normal component of the relative velocity of the 2 particles
<LI>Vt = tangential component of the relative velocity of the 2 particles 
</UL>
<P>The Kn and gamma_n coefficients are set as parameters to the
pair_style command.  You can also think of Kn as being in mg/d units
where m is mass, g is the gravitational constant, and d is the
characteristic diameter of a particle.
</P>
<P>Xmu is also specified in the pair_style command and is the upper limit
of the tangential force through the Coulomb criterion Ft = xmu*Fn.
The tangential force between 2 particles grows according to a
tangential spring and dash-pot model until Ft/Fn = xmu and is then
held at Ft = Fn*xmu until the particles lose contact.
</P>
<P>For granular styles there are no additional coefficients to set for
each pair of atom types via the <A HREF = "pair_coeff.html">pair_coeff</A> command.
All settings are global and are made via the pair_style command.
However you must still use the <A HREF = "pair_coeff.html">pair_coeff</A> for all
pairs of granular atom types.  For example the command
</P>
<PRE>pair_coeff * * 
</PRE>
<P>should be used if all atoms in the simulation interact via a granular
potential.  If a granular potential is used as part of <A HREF = "pair_hybrid.html">pair_style
hybrid</A>, then specific atom types can be used in the
pair_coeff command to determine which atoms interact via a granular
potential.

<P><B>Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info</B>:
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "pair_modify.html">pair_modify</A> mix, shift, table, and tail options
are not relevant for granular pair styles.
</P>
<P>These pair styles write their information to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>, so a pair_style command does not need to be
specified in an input script that reads a restart file.
</P>
<P>These pair styles can only be used via the <I>pair</I> keyword of the
<A HREF = "run_style.html">run_style respa</A> command.  They do not support the
<I>inner</I>, <I>middle</I>, <I>outer</I> keywords.
</P>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B> none
</P>
<P>All the granular pair styles are part of the "granular" package.  It
is only enabled if LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the
<A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_3">Making LAMMPS</A> section for more info.
