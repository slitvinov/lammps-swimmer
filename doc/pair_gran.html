<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The <I>gran</I> styles use the following formulas for the frictional force
between two granular particles, as described in <A HREF = "#Silbert">(Silbert)</A>
and in <A HREF = "#Zhang">(Zhang)</A>, when the distance r between two particles of
radii Ri and Rj is less than their contact distance d = Ri + Rj.
There is no force between the particles when r > d.
</P>
<P>The two Hookean styles use this formula:
</P>

</CENTER>
<P>The Hertzian style uses this formula:
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/pair_gran_hertz.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>In both equations the first parenthesized term is the normal force
between the two particles and the second parenthesized term is the
tangential force.  The normal force has 2 terms, a contact force and a
damping force.  The tangential force also has 2 terms: a shear force
and a damping force.  The shear force is a "history" effect that
accounts for the tangential displacement between the particles for the
duration of the time they are in contact.  This term is included in
pair styles <I>hooke/history</I> and <I>hertz/history</I>, but is not included
in pair style <I>hooke</I>.  The tangential damping force term is included
in all three pair styles if <I>dampflag</I> is set to 1; it is not included
if <I>dampflag</I> is set to 0.
</P>
<P>The other quantities in the equations are as follows:
</P>
<UL><LI>delta = d - r = overlap distance of 2 particles
<LI>Kn = elastic constant for normal contact
<LI>Kt = elastic constant for tangential contact = 2/7 of Kn
<LI>gamma_n = viscoelastic damping constant for normal contact
<LI>gamma_t = viscoelastic damping constant for tangential contact = 1/2 of gamma_n
<LI>m_eff = Mi Mj / (Mi + Mj) = effective mass of 2 particles of mass Mi and Mj
<LI>Delta St = tangential displacement vector between 2 spherical particles       which is truncated to satisfy a frictional yield criterion
<LI>n_ij = unit vector along the line connecting the centers of the 2 particles
<LI>Vn = normal component of the relative velocity of the 2 particles
<LI>Vt = tangential component of the relative velocity of the 2 particles 
</UL>
<P>The Kn and gamma_n coefficients are specified as parameters to the
pair_style command.  The interpretation and units for these
coefficients are different in the Hookean versus Hertzian formulas.
</P>
<P>The Hookean model is one where the normal push-back force for two
overlapping particles is a linear function of the overlap distance.
Thus the specified Kn is in units of (force/distance).  Note that this
push-back force is independent of absolute particle size (in the
monodisperse case) or the relative sizes of the two particles (in the
polydisperse case).  This model also applies to the other terms in the
force equation so that the specified gamma_n is in units of (1/time),
Kt is in units of (force/distance), and gamma_t is in units of
(1/time).
</P>
<P>The Hertzian model is one where the normal push-back force for two
overlapping particles is proportional to the area of overlap of the
two particles, and is thus a non-linear function of overlap distance.
Thus the specified Kn is in units of (force/area).  The effects of
absolute particle size (monodispersity) and relative size
(polydispersity) are captured in the radii-dependent pre-factors.
When these pre-factors are carried through to the other terms in the
force equation it means that the specified gamma_n is in units of
(1/time-distance), Kt is in units of (force/area), and gamma_t is in
units of (1/time-distance).
</P>
<P>Note that in the Hookean case, Kn can be thought of as a spring
constant with units of force/distance.  In the Hertzian case, Kn is
like a non-linear spring constant with units of force/area, and as
shown in the <A HREF = "#Zhang">(Zhang)</A> paper, Kn = 4G / (3(1-nu)) where nu =
the Poisson ratio, G = shear modulus = E / (1(1+nu)), and E = Young's
modulus.  Thus in the Hertzian case Kn can be set to a value that
corresponds to properties of the material being modeled.  This is also
true in the Hookean case, except that a spring constant must be chosen
that is appropriate for the size of particles in the model.  Since
relative particle sizes are not accounted for, the Hookean styles may
not be a suitable model for polydisperse systems.
</P>
<P>Xmu is also specified in the pair_style command and is the upper limit
of the tangential force through the Coulomb criterion Ft = xmu*Fn,
where Ft and Fn are the total tangential and normal force components
in the formulas above.  Thus in the Hookean case, the tangential force
between 2 particles grows according to a tangential spring and
dash-pot model until Ft/Fn = xmu and is then held at Ft = Fn*xmu until
the particles lose contact.  In the Hertzian case, a similar analogy
holds, though the spring is no longer linear.
</P>
<P>For granular styles there are no additional coefficients to set for
each pair of atom types via the <A HREF = "pair_coeff.html">pair_coeff</A> command.
All settings are global and are made via the pair_style command.
However you must still use the <A HREF = "pair_coeff.html">pair_coeff</A> for all
pairs of granular atom types.  For example the command
</P>
<PRE>pair_coeff * * 
</PRE>
<P>should be used if all atoms in the simulation interact via a granular
potential (i.e. one of the pair styles above is used).  If a granular
potential is used as a sub-style of <A HREF = "pair_hybrid.html">pair_style
hybrid</A>, then specific atom types can be used in the
pair_coeff command to determine which atoms interact via a granular
potential.

<P><B>Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info</B>:
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "pair_modify.html">pair_modify</A> mix, shift, table, and tail options
are not relevant for granular pair styles.
</P>
<P>These pair styles write their information to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>, so a pair_style command does not need to be
specified in an input script that reads a restart file.
</P>
<P>These pair styles can only be used via the <I>pair</I> keyword of the
<A HREF = "run_style.html">run_style respa</A> command.  They do not support the
<I>inner</I>, <I>middle</I>, <I>outer</I> keywords.

<P><B>Restrictions:</B> none

<P>All the granular pair styles are part of the "granular" package.  It
is only enabled if LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the
<A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_3">Making LAMMPS</A> section for more info.
