<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command sets the style of inter-processor communication that
occurs each timestep as atom coordinates and other properties are
exchanged between neighboring processors.
</P>
<P>The default style is <I>single</I> which means each processor acquires
information for ghost atoms that are within a single distance from its
sub-domain.  The distance is the maximum of the neighbor cutoff for
all atom type pairs.
</P>
<P>For many systems this is an efficient algorithm, but for systems with
widely varying cutoffs for different type pairs, the <I>multi</I> style can
be faster.  In this case, each atom type is assigned its own distance
cutoff for communication purposes, and fewer atoms will be
communicated.  See the <A HREF = "neighbor.html">neighbor multi</A> command for a
neighbor list construction option that may also be beneficial for
simulations of this kind.
</P>
<P>The <I>group</I> option will limit communication to atoms in the specified
group.  This can be useful for certain models where no ghost copies
are needed for some kinds of particles.  The particles not in the
specified group will still migrate to new processors as they move.
