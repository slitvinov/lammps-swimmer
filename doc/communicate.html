<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command sets the style of inter-processor communication that
occurs each timestep as atom coordinates and other properties are
exchanged between neighboring processors.
</P>
<P>The default style is <I>single</I> which means each processor acquires
information for ghost atoms that are within a single distance from its
sub-domain.  The distance is the maximum of the neighbor cutoff for
all atom type pairs.
</P>
<P>For many systems this is an efficient algorithm, but for systems with
widely varying cutoffs for different type pairs, the <I>multi</I> style can
be faster.  In this case, each atom type is assigned its own distance
cutoff for communication purposes, and fewer atoms will be
communicated.  See the <A HREF = "neighbor.html">neighbor multi</A> command for a
neighbor list construction option that may also be beneficial for
simulations of this kind.
