<H3>pair_style soft command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>pair_style soft cutoff 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>cutoff = global cutoff for soft interactions (distance units) 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>

<PRE>pair_style soft 2.5
pair_coeff * * 0.0 60.0
pair_coeff 1 1 0.0 60.0 3.0

<P>It is useful for pushing apart overlapping atoms, since it does not
blow up as r goes to 0.  A is a pre-factor that varies in time from
the start to the end of the run.  The <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command documents
how to make the ramping take place across multiple runs.  Rc is the
cutoff.
</P>
<P>The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atoms
types via the <A HREF = "pair_coeff.html">pair_coeff</A> command as in the examples
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
<A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> or <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A>
commands:
</P>
<UL><LI>Astart (energy units)
<LI>Astop (energy units)
<LI>cutoff (distance units) 
</UL>
<P>Astart and Astop are the values of the prefactor at the start and end
of the next run.  At intermediate times the value of A will be ramped
between these 2 values.  Note that before performing a 2nd run, you
will want to adjust the values of Astart and Astop for all type pairs,
or switch to a new pair style.
</P>
<P>The last coefficient is optional.  If not specified, the global soft
cutoff is used.
</P>
<P>If the pair_coeff command is not used to define coefficients for a
particular I != J type pair, the mixing rule for Astart and Astop is
as follows:
</P>
<PRE>A_ij = sqrt(A_i * A_j)
