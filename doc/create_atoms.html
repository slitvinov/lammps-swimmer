<H3>create_atoms command

<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>create_atoms type keyword values ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>type = atom type (1-N) of atoms to create on a lattice 

<LI>zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended 

<LI>keyword = <I>region</I> or <I>basis</I> 

<PRE>  <I>region</I> value = region-ID

    itype = atom type (1-N) to assign to the basis atom

<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command creates atoms on a lattice as an alternative to reading
in their coordinates via a <A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> or
<A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A> command.  A simulation box must
already exist, which is typically created via the
<A HREF = "create_box.html">create_box</A> command.
</P>
<P>Before using this command, a lattice must be defined using the
<A HREF = "lattice.html">lattice</A> command.  If a region is not specified, the
create_atoms command fills the entire simulation box with atoms on the
lattice.  If a region is specified (see the <A HREF = "region.html">region</A>
command), then the geometric volume is filled that is inside the
simulation box and is also consistent with the region volume.  Note
that a region can be specified so that its "volume" is either inside
or outside a geometric boundary.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "lattice.html">lattice</A> command specifies one or more basis atoms
in each unit cell.  By default, when created, all basis atoms are
assigned the argument <I>type</I> as their atom type.  The keyword <I>basis</I>
can be used to override the default for one or more basis atoms and
assign them a different atom type.
</P>
<P>By using the create_atoms command multiple times (interleaved with
<A HREF = "lattice.html">lattice</A> commands specifying different orientations),
grain boundaries can be created.  Using the create_atoms command in
conjunction with the <A HREF = "delete_atoms.html">delete_atoms</A> command,
reasonably complex geometries can be created.  The create_atoms
command can also be used to add atoms to a system previously read in
from a data or restart file.  In all these cases, care should be taken
to insure that new atoms do not overlap existing atoms
inappropriately.
</P>
<P>Created atoms are assigned a velocity of 0.0.

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>An <A HREF = "atom_style.html">atom_style</A> and <A HREF = "lattice.html">lattice</A> must be
previously defined to use this command.
