pair_style dpd command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style dpd T cutoff seed :pre

T = temperature (temperature units)
cutoff = global cutoff for DPD interactions (distance units)
seed = random # seed (integer > 0 and < 900000000) :ul

[Examples:]

pair_style dpd 1.0 2.5 34387
pair_coeff * * 3.0 1.0
pair_coeff 1 1 3.0 1.0 1.0 :pre

[Description:]

Style {dpd} computes a force field for dissipative particle dynamics
(DPD) following the exposition in "(Groot)"_#Groot.  The force
on atom I due to atom J is given as a sum of 3 terms

:c,image(Eqs/pair_dpd.jpg)

where FC is a conservative force, FD is a dissipative force, and FR is
a random force.  Rij is a unit vector in the direction Ri - Rj, Vij is
the vector difference in velocities of the two atoms = Vi - Vj, alpha
is a Gaussian random number with zero mean and unit variance, dt is
the timestep size, and w(r) is a weighting factor that varies between
0 and 1.  Rc is the cutoff.  Sigma is set equal to sqrt(2 T gamma),
where T is a parameter in the pair_style command.

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atoms
types via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command as in the examples
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
"read_data"_read_data.html or "read_restart"_read_restart.html
commands:

A (force units)
gamma (force/velocity units)
cutoff (distance units) :ul

The last coefficient is optional.  If not specified, the global DPD
cutoff is used.  Note that sigma is set equal to sqrt(2 T gamma),
where T is the temperature set by the "pair_style"_pair_style.html
command so it does not need to be specified.

[Restrictions:] none

This style is part of the "dpd" package.  It is only enabled if LAMMPS
was built with those package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#2_2 section for more info.

The {dpd} potential does not support the
"pair_modify"_pair_modify.hmtl {mix} option.  Coefficients for all i,j
pairs must be specified explicitly.

The default frequency for rebuilding neighbor lists is every 10 steps
(see the "neigh_modify"_neigh_modify.html command). This may be too
infrequent for DPD simulations since particles move rapidly and can
overlap by large amounts.  If this setting yields a non-zero number of
"dangerous" reneighborings (printed at the end of a simulation), you
should experiment with forcing reneighboring more often and see if
system energies/trajectories change.
