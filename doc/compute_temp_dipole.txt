compute temp/dipole command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID temp/dipole :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
temp/dipole = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 all temp/dipole
compute myTemp mobile temp/dipole :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the temperature of a group of
particles that include a point dipole.  The computation is similar to
"compute_temp"_compute_temp.html, however, additional degrees of
freedom are include to account for the rotational state of the
particles.  The associated kinetic energy includes a rotational term
KE_rotational = 1/2 I w^2, where I is the moment of inertia and w is
the angular velocity.

[Output info:]

The scalar value calculated by this compute is "intensive", meaning it
is independent of the number of atoms in the simulation.  The vector
values are "extensive", meaning they scale with the number of atoms in
the simulation.

[Restrictions:]

Can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the "dipole" package.

[Default:] none
