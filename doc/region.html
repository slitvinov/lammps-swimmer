</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command defines a geometric region of space.  Various other
commands use regions.  For example, the region can be filled with
atoms via the <A HREF = "create_atoms.html">create_atoms</A> command.  Or the atoms
in the region can be identified as a group via the <A HREF = "group.html">group</A>
command, or deleted via the <A HREF = "delete_atoms.html">delete_atoms</A> command.
</P>
<P>The lo/hi values for <I>block</I> or <I>cone</I> or <I>cylinder</I> or <I>prism</I> styles
can be specified as EDGE or INF.  EDGE means they extend all the way
to the global simulation box boundary.  Note that this is the current
box boundary; if the box changes size during a simulation, the region
does not.  INF means a large negative or positive number (1.0e20), so
it should encompass the simulation box even if it changes size.  If a
region is defined before the simulation box has been created (via
<A HREF = "create_box.html">create_box</A> or <A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> or
<A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A> commands), then an EDGE or INF
parameter cannot be used.
</P>
<P>For style <I>cone</I>, an axis-aligned cone is defined which is like a
<I>cylinder</I> except that two different radii (one at each end) can be
defined.
</P>
<P>For style <I>cone</I> and <I>cylinder</I>, the c1,c2 params are coordinates in
the 2 other dimensions besides the cylinder axis dimension.  For dim =
x, c1/c2 = y/z; for dim = y, c1/c2 = x/z; for dim = z, c1/c2 = x/y.
Thus the third example above specifies a cylinder with its axis in the
y-direction located at x = 2.0 and z = 3.0, with a radius of 5.0, and
extending in the y-direction from -5.0 to the upper box boundary.
</P>
<P>For style <I>prism</I>, a parallelepiped is defined (it's too hard to spell
parallelepiped in an input script!).  Think of the parallelepiped as
initially an axis-aligned orthogonal box with the same xyz lo/hi
parameters as region style <I>block</I> would define.  Then, while holding
the (xlo,ylo,zlo) corner point fixed, the box is "skewed" or "tilted"
in 3 directions.  First, for the lower xy face of the box, the <I>xy</I>
factor is how far the upper y edge is shifted in the x direction.  The
lower xy face is now a parallelogram.  A plus or minus value for <I>xy</I>
can be specified; 0.0 means no tilt.  Then, the upper xy face of the
box is translated in the x and y directions by <I>xz</I> and <I>yz</I>.  This
results in a parallelepiped whose "origin" is at (xlo,ylo,zlo) with 3
edge vectors starting from its origin given by a = (xhi-xlo,0,0); b =
(xy,yhi-ylo,0); c = (xz,yz,zhi-zlo).
</P>
<P>A prism region used with the <A HREF = "create_box.html">create_box</A> command must
have tilt factors (xy,xz,yz) that do not skew the box more than half
the distance of the parallel box length.  For example, if xlo = 2 and
xhi = 12, then the x box length is 10 and the xy tilt factor must be
between -5 and 5.  Similarly, both xz and yz must be between
-(xhi-xlo)/2 and +(yhi-ylo)/2.  Note that this is not a limitation,
since if the maximum tilt factor is 5 (as in this example), then
configurations with tilt = ..., -15, -5, 5, 15, 25, ... are all
equivalent.
</P>
<P>The <I>union</I> style creates a region consisting of the volume of all the
listed regions combined.  The <I>intersect</I> style creates a region
consisting of the volume that is common to all the listed regions.
</P>
<P>The <I>side</I> keyword determines whether the region is considered to be
inside or outside of the specified geometry.  Using this keyword in
conjunction with <I>union</I> and <I>intersect</I> regions, complex geometries
can be built up.  For example, if the interior of two spheres were
each defined as regions, and a <I>union</I> style with <I>side</I> = out was
constructed listing the region-IDs of the 2 spheres, the resulting
region would be all the volume in the simulation box that was outside
both of the spheres.
</P>
<P>The <I>units</I> keyword determines the meaning of the distance units used
to define the region.  A <I>box</I> value selects standard distance units
as defined by the <A HREF = "units.html">units</A> command, e.g. Angstroms for units
= real or metal.  A <I>lattice</I> value means the distance units are in
lattice spacings.  The <A HREF = "lattice.html">lattice</A> command must have been
previously used to define the lattice spacing.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>A prism cannot be of 0.0 thickness in any dimension; use a small z
thickness for 2d simulations.  For 2d simulations, the xz and yz
parameters must be 0.0.
