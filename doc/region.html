</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command defines a geometric region of space.  Various other
commands use regions.  For example, the region can be filled with
atoms via the <A HREF = "create_atoms.html">create_atoms</A> command.  Or the atoms
in the region can be identified as a group via the <A HREF = "group.html">group</A>
command, or deleted via the <A HREF = "delete_atoms.html">delete_atoms</A> command.
</P>
<P>The lo/hi values for <I>block</I> or <I>cylinder</I> or <I>prism</I> styles can be
specified as INF which means they extend all the way to the global
simulation box boundary.  If a region is defined before the simulation
box has been created (via <A HREF = "create_box.html">create_box</A> or
<A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> or <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A>
commands), then an INF parameter cannot be used.
</P>
<P>For style <I>cylinder</I>, the c1,c2 params are coordinates in the 2 other
dimensions besides the cylinder axis dimension.  For dim = x, c1/c2 =
y/z; for dim = y, c1/c2 = x/z; for dim = z, c1/c2 = x/y.  Thus the
third example above specifes a cylinder with its axis in the
y-direction located at x = 2.0 and z = 3.0, with a radius of 5.0, and
extending in the y-direction from -5.0 to the upper box boundary.
</P>
<P>For style <I>prism</I>, a tilted block is defined.  The bounds of the
untilted axis-aligned block are specified in the same way as for the
<I>block</I> style.  A tilt factor for each dimension with respect to
another dimension is also specified.  If the lower xy face of the
prism is initially a rectangle (untilted), then the yxtilt factor
specifies how far the upper y edge of that face is shifted in the x
direction (skewing that face, keeping the xy face a parallelogram).  A
plus or minus value can be chosen; 0.0 would be no tilt.  Similarly,
zxtilt and zytilt describe how far the upper xy face of the prism is
translated in the x and y directions to further tilt the prism.  The
final prism shape remains a parallelipiped, with opposing pairs of the
6 faces remaining parallel to each other.
</P>
<P>The <I>union</I> style creates a region consisting of the volume of all the
listed regions combined.  The <I>intesect</I> style creates a region
consisting of the volume that is common to all the listed regions.
</P>
<P>The <I>side</I> keyword determines whether the region is considered to be
inside or outside of the specified geometry.  Using this keyword in
conjunction with <I>union</I> and <I>intersect</I> regions, complex geometries
can be built up.  For example, if the interior of two spheres were
each defined as regions, and a <I>union</I> style with <I>side</I> = out was
constructed listing the region-IDs of the 2 spheres, the resulting
region would be all the volume in the simulation box that was outside
both of the spheres.
</P>
<P>The <I>units</I> keyword determines the meaning of the distance units used
to define the region.  A <I>box</I> value selects standard distance units
as defined by the <A HREF = "units.html">units</A> command, e.g. Angstroms for units
= real or metal.  A <I>lattice</I> value means the distance units are in
lattice spacings.  The <A HREF = "lattice.html">lattice</A> command must have been
previously used to define the lattice spacing.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B> none
</P>
<P>A prism cannot be of 0.0 thickness in any dimension; use a small z
thickness for 2d simulations.  For 2d simulations, the zxtilt and
zytilt parameters must be 0.0.
