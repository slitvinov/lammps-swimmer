compute ebond/atom command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID ebond/atom :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
ebond/atom = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 all ebond/atom :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that computes the per-atom bond energy for each
atom in a group.  This can be output via the "dump custom"_dump.html
command.

The bond energy for each atom is computed by looping over its
neighbors and computing the energy associated with the defined
"pair_style"_pair_style.html command for each IJ pair (divided by 2).
Thus the sum of per-atom energy for all atoms should give the total
pairwise energy of the system.

If two atoms are bonded and only one of them is in the compute group,
the energy of the bond is included in the per-atom energy of the atom
in the group.

Computation of per-atom bond energy requires a loop thru the bond list
and inter-processor communication, so it can be inefficient to
compute/dump this quantity too frequently or to have multiple
compute/dump commands, each of a {ebond/atom} style.
