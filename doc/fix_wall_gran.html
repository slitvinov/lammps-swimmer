<H3>fix wall/gran command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>fix ID group-ID wall/gran wallstyle args keyword values ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID, group-ID are documented in <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> command 

<LI>wall/gran = style name of this fix command 

<LI>style = <I>xplane</I> or <I>yplane</I> or <I>zplane</I> or <I>zcylinder</I> 

<LI>args = list of arguments for a particular style 

<PRE>  <I>xplane</I> or <I>yplane</I> or <I>zplane</I> args = lo hi gamma xmu
    lo, hi = position of lower and upper plane (either can be NULL)
    gamman = damping coeff for normal direction collisions with wall
    xmu = friction coeff for the wall
  <I>zcylinder</I> args = radius gamma xmu
    radius = cylinder radius (distance units)
    gamman = damping coeff for normal direction collisions with wall
    xmu = friction coeff for the wall 
</PRE>
<LI>zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended to args 

<PRE>  keyword = <I>wiggle</I>
    values = dim amplitude period
      dim = <I>x</I> or <I>y</I> or <I>z</I>
      amplitude = size of oscillation (distance units)
      period = time of oscillation (time units)

<P><B>Examples:</B>

<PRE>fix 1 all wall/gran xplane -10.0 10.0 50.0 0.5

fix 1 all wall/gran zplane 0.0 NULL 100.0 0.5 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Bound the simulation domain of a granular system with a frictional
wall.  All particles in the group interact with the wall when they are
close enough to touch it.
</P>
<P>The <I>wallstyle</I> can be planar or cylindrical.  The 3 planar options
specify a pair of walls in a dimension.  Wall positions are given by
<I>lo</I> and <I>hi</I>.  Either of the values can be specified as NULL if a
single wall is desired.  For a <I>zcylinder</I> wallstyle, the cylinder's
axis is at x = y = 0.0, and the radius of the cylinder is specified.
For all wallstyles, a damping and friction coefficient for
particle-wall interactions are also specified.
</P>
<P>Optionally, a wall can be oscillated, similar to the oscillations of
frozen particles specified by the <A HREF = "fix_wiggle.html">fix_wiggle</A>
command.  This is useful in packing simulations of granular particles.
If the keyword <I>wiggle</I> is appended to the argument list, then a
dimension for the motion, as well as it's <I>amplitude</I> and <I>period</I> is
specified.  Each timestep, the position of the wall in the appropriate
<I>dim</I> is set according to this equation:
</P>
<PRE>position = pos0 + A - A cos (omega * delta) 
</PRE>
<P>where <I>pos0</I> is the position at the time the fix was specified, <I>A</I> is
the <I>amplitude</I>, <I>omega</I> is 2 PI / <I>period</I>, and <I>delta</I> is the
elapsed time since the fix was specified.  The velocity of the wall is
also set to the derivative of this expression.
</P>
<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, thermo output, run start/stop, minimize info:</B>
</P>
<P>This fix writes the shear friction state of atoms interacting with the
wall to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart files</A>, so that a simulation can
continue correctly if granular potentials with shear "history" effects
are being used.  See the <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A> command for
info on how to re-specify a fix in an input script that reads a
restart file, so that the operation of the fix continues in an
uninterrupted fashion.
</P>
<P>None of the <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> options are relevant to this
fix.  No quantities calculated by this fix can be output by the
<A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermo_style custom</A> command.  No parameter of this
fix can be used with the <I>start/stop</I> keywords of the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A>
command.  This fix is not invoked during <A HREF = "minimize.html">energy
minimization</A>.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This fix is part of the "granular" package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info.
</P>
<P>Any dimension (xyz) that has a granular wall must be non-periodic.
</P>
<P>A zcylinder wall can only be oscillated in the z dimension.
