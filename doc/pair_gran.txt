pair_style gran/hertizian command :h3
pair_style gran/history command :h3
pair_style gran/no_history command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style style Kn gamma_n xmu dampflag :pre

style = {gran/hertzian} or {gran/history} or {gran/no_history} :ulb,l
Kn = spring constant for particle repulsion :l
  (mg/d units where m is mass, g is the gravitational constant, d is diameter of a particle) :pre
gamma_n = damping coefficient for normal direction collisions (sqrt(g/d) units) :l
xmu = static yield criterion :l
dampflag = flag (0/1) for whether to (no/yes) include tangential damping :l,ule

[Examples:]

pair_style gran/history 200000.0 0.5 1.0 1 :pre

[Description:]

The {gran} styles use the following formula "(Silbert)"_#Silbert for
frictional force between two granular particles that are a distance r
apart when r is less than the contact distance d.

:c,image(Eqs/pair_granular.jpg)

The 1st term is a normal force and the 2nd term is a tangential force.
The other quantites are as follows:

delta = d - r
f(x) = 1 for Hookean contacts used in pair styles {history} and {no_history}
f(x) = sqrt(x) for pair style {hertzian}
Kn = elastic constant for normal contact
Kt = elastic constant for tangential contact = 2/7 of Kn
gamma_n = viscoelastic constants for normal contact
gamma_t = viscoelastic constants for tangential contact = 1/2 of gamma_n
m_eff = Mi Mj / (Mi + Mj) = effective mass of 2 particles of mass Mi and Mj
Delta St = tangential displacement vector between the 2 spherical particles \
      which is truncated to satisfy a frictional yield criterion
n = a unit vector along the line connecting the centers of the 2 particles
Vn = normal component of the relative velocity of the 2 particles
Vt = tangential component of the relative velocity of the 2 particles :ul

The Kn and gamma_n coefficients are set as parameters to the
pair_style command.  Xmu is also specified which is the upper limit of
the tangential force through the Coulomb criterion Ft = xmu*Fn.  The
tangential force between 2 particles grows according to a tangential
spring and dash-pot model until Ft/Fn = xmu and then is held at Ft =
Fn*xmu until the particles lose contact.

For granular styles there are no individual atom type coefficients
that can be set via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command.  All
global settings are made via the pair_style command.

See the citation below for more discussion of granular potentials.

[Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, per-atom energy/stress, and
restart info]:

The "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html mix, shift, table, and tail options
are not relevant for granular pair styles.

This pair style does not calculate per-atom energy and stress, as used
by the "compute epair/atom"_compute_epair_atom.html, "compute
stress/atom"_compute_stress_atom.html, and "dump custom"_dump.html
commands.

This pair style writes its information to "binary restart
files"_restart.html, so a pair_style commands does not need to be
specified in an input script that reads a restart file.

[Restrictions:] none

All the granular pair styles are part of the "granular" package.  It
is only enabled if LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the
"Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#2_3 section for more info.

"pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html

[Default:] none
