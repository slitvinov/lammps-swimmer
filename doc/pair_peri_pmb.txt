pair_style peri/pmb command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style peri/pmb :pre 

[Examples:]

pair_style peri/pmb
pair_coeff * * 1.6863e22 0.0015001 0.0005 0.25 :pre

[Description:]

Style {peri/pmb} style implements the Peridynamic bond-based prototype
microelastic brittle (PMB) model, which can be used to model materials
at the mesoscopic or macroscopic scale.  The implementation of
Peridynamics in LAMMPS is described in "(Parks)"_#Parks.  Also see the
"PDLAMMPS user
guide"_http://www.sandia.gov/~mlparks/papers/PDLAMMPS.pdf for more
details about this particular potential.

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atom
types via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command as in the examples
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
"read_data"_read_data.html or "read_restart"_read_restart.html
commands, or by mixing as described below:

K (energy/distance^2 units)
horizon (distance units)
s00 (?? units)
alpha (?? units) :ul

K is the spring constant for Peridynamic bonds, the horizon is a
cutoff distance for truncating interactions, and s00 and alpha are
used as a bond breaking criteria.  See the users guide for more
details.

[Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info]:

This pair style does not support mixing.  Thus, coefficients for all
I,J pairs must be specified explicitly.

This pair style does not support the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html
shift option.

The "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html table and tail options are not
relevant for this pair style.

This pair style writes its information to "binary restart
files"_restart.html, so pair_style and pair_coeff commands do not need
to be specified in an input script that reads a restart file.

This pair style can only be used via the {pair} keyword of the
"run_style respa"_run_style.html command.  It does not support the
{inner}, {middle}, {outer} keywords.

[Restrictions:]

The {peri/pmb} style is part of the "peri" package.  It is only
enabled if LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#2_3 section for more info.

[Related commands:]

"pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html

[Default:] none
