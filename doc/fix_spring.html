<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Apply a spring force to a group of atoms or between two groups of
atoms.  This is useful for applying an umbrella force to a small
molecule or lightly tethering a large group of atoms (e.g. all the
solvent or a large molecule) to the center of the simulation box so
that it doesn't wander away over the course of a long simulation.  It
can also be used to hold the centers of mass of two groups of atoms at
a given distance or orientation with respect to each other.
</P>
<P>The <I>tether</I> style attaches a spring between a fixed point <I>x,y,z</I> and
the center of mass of the fix group of atoms.  The equilibrium
position of the spring is R0.  At each timestep the distance R from
the center of mass of the group of atoms to the tethering point is
computed, taking account of wrap-around in a periodic simulation box.
A restoring force of magnitude K (R - R0) Mi / M is applied to each
atom in the group where <I>K</I> is the spring constant, Mi is the mass of
the atom, and M is the total mass of all atoms in the group.  Note
that <I>K</I> thus represents the total force on the group of atoms, not a
per-atom force.
</P>
<P>The <I>couple</I> style links two groups of atoms together.  The first
group is the fix group; the second is specified by group-ID2.  The
groups are coupled together by a spring that is at equilibrium when
the two groups are displaced by a vector <I>x,y,z</I> with respect to each
other and at a distance R0 from that displacement.  Note that <I>x,y,z</I>
is the equilibrium displacement of group-ID2 relative to the fix
group.  Thus (1,1,0) is a different spring than (-1,-1,0).  When the
relative positions and distance between the two groups are not in
equilibrium, the same spring force described above is applied to atoms
in each of the two groups.
</P>
<P>For both the <I>tether</I> and <I>couple</I> styles, any of the x,y,z values can
be specified as NULL which means do not include that dimension in the
distance calculation or force application.
</P>
<P>The first example above pulls the ligand towards the point (0,0,0).
The second example holds the ligand near the surface of a sphere of
radius 5 around the point (0,0,0).  The third example holds the ligand
a distance 3 away from the z=2 plane (on either side).
</P>
<P>The fourth example holds 2 bilayers a distance 10 apart in z.  For the
last two examples, imagine a pore (a slab of atoms with a cylindrical
hole cut out) oriented with the pore axis along z, and an ion moving
within the pore.  The fifth example holds the ion a distance of -20
below the z = 0 center plane of the pore (umbrella sampling).  The
last example holds the ion a distance 5 away from the pore axis
(assuming the center-of-mass of the pore in x,y is the pore axis).
