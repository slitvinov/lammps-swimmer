<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Add a viscous damping force to atoms in the group that is proportional
to the velocity of the atom.  The added force can be thought of as a
frictional interaction with implicit solvent.  In granular simulations
this can be useful for draining the kinetic energy from the system in
a controlled fashion.  If used without additional thermostatting (to
add kinetic energy to the system), it has the effect of slowly (or
rapidly) freezing the system; hence it is a simple energy minimization
technique.
</P>
<P>The damping force F is given by F = - gamma * velocity.  The larger
the coefficient, the faster the kinetic energy is reduced.  If the
optional keyword <I>scale</I> is used, gamma can scaled up or down by the
specified factor for atoms of that type.  It can be used multiple
times to adjust gamma for several atom types.
</P>
<P>In a Brownian dynamics context, gamma = kT / mD, where k = Bolztmann's
constant, T = temperature, m = particle mass, and D = particle
diffusion coefficient.  D can be written as kT / (6 pi eta d), where
eta = viscosity of the frictional fluid and d = diameter of particle.
This means gamma = 6 pi eta d, and thus is proportional to the
viscosity of the fluid and the particle diameter.
</P>
<P>In the current implementation, rather than have the user specify a
viscosity (in centiPoise or some other units), gamma is specified
directly in force/velocity units.  If needed, gamma can be adjusted
for atoms of different sizes (i.e. sigma) by using the <I>scale</I>
keyword.
</P>
<P>Note that Brownian dynamics models also typically include a randomized
force term to thermostat the system at a chosen temperature.  The <A HREF = "fix_langevin.html">fix
langevin</A> command adds both a viscous damping term
and this random force to each atom; hence if using fix <I>langevin</I> you
do not typically need to use fix <I>viscous</I>.

output by the <A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermo_style custom</A> command.  No
parameter of this fix can be used with the <I>start/stop</I> keywords of
