<H3>compute erotate/asphere command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>compute ID group-ID erotate/asphere 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID, group-ID are documented in <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> command
<LI>erotate/asphere = style name of this compute command 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>compute 1 all erotate/asphere 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a computation that calculates the rotational kinetic energy of
a group of aspherical particles.
</P>
<P>The rotational kinetic energy is computed as 1/2 I w^2, where I is the
inertia tensor for the aspherical particle and w is its angular
velocity, which is computed from its angular momentum.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: For <A HREF = "dimension.html">2d models</A>, particles are treated
as ellipsoids, not ellipses, meaning their moments of inertia will be
the same as in 3d.
</P>
<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>The scalar value calculated by this compute is "extensive", meaning it
it scales with the number of atoms in the simulation.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This compute requires that particles be represented as extended
ellipsoids and not point particles.  This means they will have an
angular momentum and a shape which is determined by the
<A HREF = "shape.html">shape</A> command.
