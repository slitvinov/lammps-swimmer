pair_style soft command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style soft cutoff :pre

cutoff = global cutoff for soft interactions (distance units) :ul

[Examples:]

pair_style soft 2.5
pair_coeff * * 0.0 60.0
pair_coeff 1 1 0.0 60.0 3.0 :pre

[Description:]

Style {soft} computes pairwise interactions with the formula

:c,image(Eqs/pair_soft.jpg)

It is useful for pushing apart overlapping atoms, since it does not
blow up as r goes to 0.  A is a pre-factor that varies in time from
the start to the end of the run.  The "run"_run.html command documents
how to make the ramping take place across multiple runs.  Rc is the
cutoff.

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atoms
types via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command as in the examples
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
"read_data"_read_data.html or "read_restart"_read_restart.html
commands:

Astart (energy units)
Astop (energy units)
cutoff (distance units) :ul

Astart and Astop are the values of the prefactor at the start and end
of the next run.  At intermediate times the value of A will be ramped
between these 2 values.  Note that before performing a 2nd run, you
will want to adjust the values of Astart and Astop for all type pairs,
or switch to a new pair style.

The last coefficient is optional.  If not specified, the global soft
cutoff is used.

If the pair_coeff command is not used to define coefficients for a
particular I != J type pair, the mixing rule for Astart and Astop is
as follows:

A_ij = sqrt(A_i * A_j) :pre
