fix freeze command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID freeze :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command
freeze = style name of this fix command :ul

[Examples:]

fix 2 bottom freeze :pre

[Description:]

Zero out the force and torque on a granular particle.  This is useful
for preventing certain particles from moving in a simulation.

[Restrictions:]

Can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the "granular" package.

There can only be a single freeze fix defined.  This is because other
parts of the code (pair potentials, thermodynamics, etc) treat frozen
particles differently and need to be able to reference a single group
to which this fix is applied.
