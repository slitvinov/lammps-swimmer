fix freeze command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID freeze :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command
freeze = style name of this fix command :ul

[Examples:]

fix 2 bottom freeze :pre

[Description:]

Zero out the force and torque on a granular particle.  This is useful
for preventing certain particles from moving in a simulation.

[Restart, fix_modify, thermo output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  None of the "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html options
are relevant to this fix.  No quantities calculated by this fix can be
output by the "thermo_style custom"_thermo_style.html command.  No
parameter of this fix can be used with the {start/stop} keywords of
the "run"_run.html command.  This fix is not invoked during "energy
minimization"_minimize.html.

[Restrictions:]

This fix is part of the "granular" package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#2_3 section for more info.

There can only be a single freeze fix defined.  This is because other
parts of the code (pair potentials, thermodynamics, etc) treat frozen
particles differently and need to be able to reference a single group
to which this fix is applied.

[Related commands:] none

"atom_style granular"_atom_style.html

[Default:] none
