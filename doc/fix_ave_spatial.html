<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Calculate one or more instantaneous per-atom quantities every few
timesteps, average them by layer in a chosen dimension and over a
longer timescale, and print the results to a file.  This can be used
to spatially average per-atom properties such as velocity or energy or
a quantity calculated by an equation you define; see the <A HREF = "variable.html">variable
atom</A> command.
</P>
<P>The <I>density</I> keyword means to simply count the number of atoms in
each layer.  The <I>atom</I> keyword allows an atom property such as
x-velocity to be specified.  The <I>compute</I> keyword allows
specification of a <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> which will be invoked to
calculate the desired property.  The compute can be previously defined
in the input script.  Note that the "compute variable/atom" style
allows you to calculate any quantity for an atom that can be specified
by a <A HREF = "variable.html">variable atom</A> equation.  Users can also write
code for their own compute styles and <A HREF = "Section_modify.html">add them to
LAMMPS</A>.  Note that the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump custom</A>
command can also be used to output per-atom quantities calculated by a
compute.
</P>
<P>For the <I>compute</I> keyword, the fix ave/spatial style uses the per-atom
scalar or vector calculated by the compute.  See the <A HREF = "fix_ave_time.html">fix
ave/time</A> command if you wish to time-average a
global quantity, e.g. via a compute that temperature or pressure.
</P>
<P>In all cases, the calculated property is averaged over atoms in each
layer, where the layers are in a particular <I>dim</I> and have a thickness
given by <I>delta</I>.  Every Nfreq steps, when a property is calculated
for the first time (after a previous write), the number of layers and
the layer boundaries are computed.  Thus if the simlation box changes
size during a simulation, the number of layers and their boundaries
may also change.  Layers are defined relative to a specified <I>origin</I>,
which may be the lower/upper edge of the box (in <I>dim</I>) or its center
point, or a specified coordinate value.  Starting at the origin,
sufficient layers are created in both directions to completely cover
the box.  On subsequent timesteps every atom is mapped to one of the
layers.  Atoms beyond the lowermost/uppermost layer are counted in the
first/last layer.
</P>
<P>The <I>Nevery</I> and <I>Nfreq</I> arguments specify how the property calculated
for each layer is time-averaged.  The property is calculated once each
Nevery timesteps.  It is averaged and output every Nfreq timesteps.
Nfreq must be a multiple of Nevery.  In the 2nd example above, the
property is calculated every 100 steps.  After 10 calculations, the
average result is written to the file, once every 1000 steps.
</P>
<P>Each time info is written to the file, it is in the following format.
A line with the timestep and number of layers is written.  Then one
line per layer is written, containing the layer ID (1-N), the
coordinate of the center of the layer, the number of atoms in the
layer, and one or more calculated values.  The number of atoms and the
value(s) are average quantities.
</P>
<P>If the <I>density</I> or <I>atom</I> keyword is used, or the <I>compute</I> keyword
with a compute that calculates a single quantity per atom, then a
single value will be printed for each layer.  If the <I>compute</I> keyword
is used with a compute that calculates N quantities per atom, then N
values per line will be written, each of them averaged independently.
</P>
<P>Note that for the <I>density</I> keyword, the printed count of atoms in the
layer is actually what you should use to infer a density.  The
calculated value is always 1.0, since it is normalized by the number
of atoms in the layer.
</P>
<P>For the <I>compute</I> keyword, the calculation performed by the compute in
on the group defined by the compute.  However, only atoms in the fix
group are included in the layer averaging.  LAMMPS prints a warning if
the fix group and compute group do not match.
</P>
<P>Note that some computes perform costly calculations, involving use of
or creation of neighbor lists.  If the compute is invoked too often by
fix ave/spatial, it can slow down a simulation.
