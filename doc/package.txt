:line

package command :h3

[Syntax:]

package style args :pre

style = {cuda} :ulb,l
args = 0 or more args specific to the style :l
  {cuda} args = to be determined :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

package cuda blah :pre

[Description:]

This command is to set package-specific settings.  Currently only
the USER-CUDA package uses it.

The {cuda} style invokes options associated with the use of the
USER-CUDA package.  These will be described when the USER-CUDA package
is released with LAMMPS.

[Restrictions:]

The cuda style of this command can only be invoked if LAMMPS was built
with the USER-CUDA package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#2_3 section for more info.

Obviously, you must have GPU hardware and associated software to build
and use LAMMPS with either the GPU or USER-CUDA packages.
