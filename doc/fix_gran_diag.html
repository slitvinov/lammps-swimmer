<P><B>Syntax:</B>

<PRE>fix ID group-ID gran/diag nevery file zlayer 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID, group-ID are documented in <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> command
<LI>gran/diag = style name of this fix command
<LI>nevery = compute diagnostics every this many timesteps
<LI>file = filename to store diagnostic info in
<LI>zlayer = bin size in z dimension 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>

<PRE>fix 1 all gran/diag 1000 tmp 0.9 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Compute aggregate density, velocity, and stress diagnostics for a
group of granular atoms as a function of z depth in the granular
system.  The results are written to 3 files named file.den, file.vel,
and file.str.  The z bins begin at the bottom of the system and extend
upward with a thickness of <I>zlayer</I> for each bin.  The quantities
written to the file are averaged over all atoms in the bin.

<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, thermo output, run start/stop, minimize info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.  None of the <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> options
are relevant to this fix.  No quantities calculated by this fix can be
output by the <A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermo_style custom</A> command.  No
parameter of this fix can be used with the <I>start/stop</I> keywords of
the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command.  This fix is not invoked during <A HREF = "minimize.html">energy
minimization</A>.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This fix is part of the "granular" package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info.
