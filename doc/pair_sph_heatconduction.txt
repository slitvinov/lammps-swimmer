pair_style sph/heatconduction command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style sph/heatconduction :pre

[Examples:]

pair_style sph/heatconduction
pair_coeff * * 1.0 2.4

[Description:]

The sph/heatconduction style computes heat transport between SPH particles.
The transport model is the diffusion euqation for the internal energy.

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atoms
types via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command as in the examples
above.

D diffusion coefficient (length^2/time units)
h kernel function cutoff (distance units)

[Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info]:

These pair styles do not support mixing.  Thus, coefficients for all
I,J pairs must be specified explicitly.

This style does not write information to "binary restart
files"_restart.html, so pair_style and pair_coeff commands do need
to be specified in an input script that reads a restart file.

These styles can only be used via the {pair} keyword of the "run_style
respa"_run_style.html command.  They do not support the {inner},
{middle}, {outer} keywords.

[Restrictions:]

The {pair sph/heatconduction} style is part of the "USER-SPH" package.  It is
only enabled if LAMMPS was built with that package (which it is by
default).  See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#2_3 section for
more info.
