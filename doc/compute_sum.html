<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a calculation that sums the results of one or more per-atom
quantities across all atoms in the group to yield a global scalar or
vector quantity.  The resulting value(s) can be accessed by any
command that uses global computes, e.g. the <A HREF = "therml_style.html">thermo
custom</A> command or <A HREF = "fix_ave_time.html">fix ave/time</A>
command or by a <A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> command.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#4_15">this
section</A> of the documentation for an overview
of output options.
</P>
<P>Each listed value is summed independently.  The group specified with
the command means only atoms within the group contribute to the sum.
Note that the value that produces the per-atom quantities may define
its own group which affects the values it returns.  For example, if a
per-atom compute is used as a value, it will generate values of 0.0
for atoms that are not in the group specified for that compute.
</P>
<P>Each listed value can be an atom attribute (position, velocity, force
component) or can be the result of a <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> or
<A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> or the evaluation of an atom-style
<A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A>.  In the latter cases, the compute, fix, or
variable must produce a per-atom quantity, not a global quantity.
</P>
<P><A HREF = "compute.html">Computes</A> that produce per-atom quantities are those
which have the word <I>atom</I> in their style name.  Currently the only
fix that produces per-atom quantities is the <A HREF = "fix_ave_atom.html">fix
ave/atom</A> command.  <A HREF = "variable.html">Variables</A> of
style <I>atom</I> are the only ones that can be used with this compute
since all other variable stylse produce global quantities.
</P>
<P>If a single value is specified this compute produces a global scalar
value.  If multiple values are specified, this compute produces a
vector of global values, the length of which is equal to the
number of values specified.
</P>
<P>The value(s) produced by this compute are all "extensive", meaning
their value scales linearly with the number of atoms involved.  If
normalized values are desired, this compute can be accessed by the
<A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermo_style custom</A> command with <A HREF = "thermo_modify.html">thermo_modify
norm yes</A> set as an option.  Or it can be accessed
by a <A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> that divides by the appropriate atom
count.

<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>The scalar and vector values calculated by this compute are
"extensive", meaning they scale with the number of atoms in the
simulation.
