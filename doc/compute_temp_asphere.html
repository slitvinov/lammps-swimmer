<PRE>compute ID group-ID temp/asphere 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID, group-ID are documented in <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> command
<LI>temp/asphere = style name of this compute command 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>compute 1 all temp/asphere
compute myTemp mobile temp/asphere 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a computation that calculates the temperature of a group of
aspherical or ellipsoidal particles.  The computation is similar to
<A HREF = "compute_temp.html">compute_temp</A>, however, additional degrees of
freedom (2 or 3) are incorporated for particles where the principal
moments of inertia are unequal.  The associated kinetic energy thus
includes a rotational term KE_rotational = 1/2 I w^2, where I is the
moment of inertia and w is the angular velocity.
</P>
<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>The scalar value calculated by this compute is "intensive", meaning it
is independent of the number of atoms in the simulation.  The vector
values are "extensive", meaning they scale with the number of atoms in
the simulation.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>Can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the "asphere" package.
