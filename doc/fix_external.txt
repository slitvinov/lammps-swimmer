fix external command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID external :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command
external = style name of this fix command :ul

[Examples:]

fix 1 all external :pre

[Description:]

This fix makes a callback each timestep to an external driver program
that is using LAMMPS as a library.  This is a way to let another
program compute forces on atoms which LAMMPS will include in its
dynamics performed by the "run"_run.html command.

The callback function "foo" will be invoked every timestep as:

foo(ptr,timestep,nlocal,ids,x,fexternal); :pre

which has this prototype:

void foo(void *, int, int, int *, double **, double **);

The arguments are as follows:

ptr = pointer provided by and simply passed back to external driver
timestep = current LAMMPS timestep
nlocal = # of atoms on this processor
ids = list of atom IDs on this processor
x = coordinates of atoms on this processor
fexternal = forces on atoms on this processor :ul

Fexternal are the forces returned by the driver program,
which LAMMPS adds to the current force on each atom.

See the couple/lammps_quest/lmpqst.cpp file in the LAMMPS distribution
for an example of a coupling application that uses this fix, and how
it makes a call to the fix to specify what function the fix should
callback to.  The sample application performs classical MD using
quantum forces computed by a density functional code "Quest"_quest.
