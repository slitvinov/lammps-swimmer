<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Use the Muller-Plathe algorithm described in <A HREF = "#Muller-Plathe">this
paper</A> to exchange momenta between two particles in
different regions of the simulation box every N steps.  This induces a
shear velocity profile in the system.  As described below this enables
a viscosity of the fluid to be calculated.  This algorithm is
sometimes called a reverse non-equilibrium MD (reverse NEMD) approach
to computing viscosity.  This is because the usual NEMD approach is to
impose a shear velocity profile on the system and measure the response
via an off-diagonal component of the stress tensor, which is
proportional to the momentum flux.  In the Muller-Plathe method, the
momentum flux is imposed, and the shear velocity profile is the
system's response.
</P>
<P>The simulation box is divided into <I>Nbin</I> layers in the <I>pdim</I>
direction.  Every N steps, two atoms are chosen in the following
manner.  Only atoms in the fix group are considered.  The atom in the
bottom layer with the most positive momentum component in the <I>vdim</I>
direction is the first atom.  The atom in the middle later with the
most negative momentum component in the <I>vdim</I> direction is the second
atom.  The <I>vdim</I> momenta components of these two atoms are swapped,
which resets their velocities, typically in opposite directions.  Over
time, this induces a shear velocity profile in the system which can be
measured using commands such as the following, which writes the
profile to the file tmp.profile:
</P>
<PRE>compute		c1 all attribute/atom vx
fix		f1 all ave/spatial 100 10 1000 z lower 0.05 tmp.profile &
		compute c1 units reduced 
</PRE>
<P>As described below, the total momentum transferred by these velocity
swaps is computed by the fix and can be output.  Dividing this
quantity by time and the cross-sectional area of the simulation box
yields a momentum flux.  The ratio of momentum flux to the slope of
the shear velocity profile is the viscosity of the fluid, in
appopriate units.  See the <A HREF = "#Muller-Plathe">Muller-Plathe paper</A> for
details.
</P>
<P>An alternative method for calculating a viscosity is to run a NEMD
simulation, as described in <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#4_13">this section</A> of
the manual.  NEMD simulations deform the simmulation box via the <A HREF = "fix_deform.html">fix
deform</A> command.  Thus they cannot be run on a charged
system using a <A HREF = "kspace_style.html">PPPM solver</A> since PPPM does not
currently support non-orthogonal boxes.  Using fix viscosity keeps the
box orthogonal; thus it does not suffer from this limitation.

<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.  None of the <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> options
are relevant to this fix.
</P>
<P>The cummulative momentum transferred between the bottom and middle of
the simulatoin box (in the <I>pdim</I> direction) is stored as a scalar
quantity by this fix.  This quantity is zeroed when the fix is defined
and accumlates thereafter, once every N steps.  The units of the
quantity are momentum = mass*velocity.  This quantity can be
accessed by various <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#4_15">output commands</A>, such as
<A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermo_style custom</A>.
</P>
<P>No parameter of this fix can be used with the <I>start/stop</I> keywords of
the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command.  This fix is not invoked during <A HREF = "minimize.html">energy
minimization</A>.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>If the masses of the atom pairs are the same, the swaps conserve both
momentum and kinetic energy.  Thus you should not need to thermostat
the system.  If you do use a thermostat, you may want to apply it only
to the non-swapped dimensions (other than <I>vdim</I>).
</P>
<P>LAMMPS does not check, but you should not use this fix to swap
velocities of atoms that are in constrained molecules, e.g. via <A HREF = "fix_shake.html">fix
shake</A> or <A HREF = "fix_rigid.html">fix rigid</A>.  This is because
application of the constraints will alter the amount of transferred
momentum.  You should, however, be able to use flexible molecules.
See the <A HREF = "#Maginn">Maginn paper</A> for an example of using this algorithm
in a computation of alcohol molecule properties.
</P>
<P>When running a simulation with large, massive particles or molecules
in a background solvent, you may want to only exchange momenta bewteen
solvent particles.
