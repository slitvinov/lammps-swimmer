fix gravity command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group gravity style args :pre

ID, group are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
gravity = style name of this fix command :l
style = {chute} or {spherical} or {gradient} or {vector} :l
  {chute} args = angle
    angle = angle in +x away from -z axis (in degrees)
  {spherical} args = phi theta
    phi = azimuthal angle from +x axis (in degrees)
    theta = angle from +z axis (in degrees)
  {gradient} args = phi theta phi_grad theta_grad
    phi = azimuthal angle from +x axis (in degrees)
    theta = angle from +z axis (in degrees)
    phi_grad = rate of change of angle phi (full rotations per time unit)
    theta_grad = rate of change of angle theta
      (full rotations per time unit)
  {vector} args = magnitude x y z
    magnitude = size of acceleration (force/mass units)
    x y z = vector direction to apply the acceleration :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

fix 1 all gravity chute 24.0
fix 1 all gravity spherical 0.0 -180.0
fix 1 all gravity gradient 0.0 -180.0 0.0 0.1
fix 1 all gravity vector 100.0 1 1 0 :pre

[Description:]

Impose an additional acceleration on each particle in the group.  For
granular systems the magnitude is chosen so as to be due to gravity.
For non-granular systems the magnitude of the acceleration is
specified, so it can be any kind of driving field desired (e.g. a
pressure gradient inducing a Poisselle flow).  Note that this is
different from what the "fix addforce"_fix_addforce.html command does,
since it adds the same force to each atom, independent of its mass.
This command adds the same acceleration to each atom (force/mass).

The first 3 styles apply to granular systems.  Style {chute} is
typically used for simulations of chute flow where the specified angle
is the chute angle, with flow occurring in the +x direction.  Style
{spherical} allows an arbitrary 3d direction to be specified for the
gravity vector.  Style {gradient} allows the direction of the gravity
vector to be time dependent.  The units of the gradient arguments are
in full rotations per time unit.  E.g. a timestep of 0.001 and a
gradient of 0.1 means the gravity vector would rotate thru 360 degrees
every 10,000 timesteps.  For the time-dependent case, the initial
direction of the gravity vector is phi,theta at the time the fix is
specified.

Phi and theta are defined in the usual spherical coordinates.  Thus
for gravity acting in the -z direction, theta would be specified as
180.0 (or -180.0).  Theta = 90.0 and phi = -90.0 would mean gravity
acts in the -y direction.

Style {vector} is used for non-granular systems.  An acceleration of
the specified magnitude is applied to each atom in the group in the
vector direction given by (x,y,z).

The strength of the acceleration due to gravity is 1.0 in LJ units,
which are the only allowed units for granular systems.

[Restart, fix_modify, thermo output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  None of the "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html options
are relevant to this fix.  No quantities calculated by this fix can be
output by the "thermo_style custom"_thermo_style.html command.  No
parameter of this fix can be used with the {start/stop} keywords of
the "run"_run.html command.  This fix is not invoked during "energy
minimization"_minimize.html.

[Restrictions:]

Styles {chute}, {spherical}, and {gradient} can only be used with
atom_style granular.  Style {vector} can only be used with
non-granular systems.
