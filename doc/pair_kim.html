<H3>pair_style kim command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>pair_style kim model 
</PRE>
<P>model = name of KIM model (potential)
</P>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>pair_style kim model_Ar_P_Morse
pair_coeff * * Ar Ar 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This pair style is a wrapper on the Knowledge Base for Interatomic
Models (KIM) repository of interatomic potentials, so that they can be
used by LAMMPS scripts.
</P>
<P>In KIM lingo, a potential is a "model" and a model contains both the
analytic formulas that define the potential as well as the parameters
needed to run it for one or more materials, including coefficients and
cutoffs.
</P>
<P>The argument <I>model</I> is the name of the model for a specific potential
as KIM defines it.  In principle, LAMMPS can invoke any KIM model.
You should get an error message from either LAMMPS or KIM if there is
an incompatibility.
</P>
<P>Only a single pair_coeff command is used with the <I>kim</I> style which
specifies the mapping of LAMMPS atom types to KIM elements.  This is
done by specifying N additional arguments after the "* *" in the
pair_coeff command, where N is the number of LAMMPS atom types:
</P>
<UL><LI>N element names = mapping of KIM elements to atom types 
</UL>
<P>As an example, imagine the KIM model supports Si and C atoms.  If your
LAMMPS simulation has 4 atoms types and you want the 1st 3 to be Si,
and the 4th to be C, you would use the following pair_coeff command:
</P>
<PRE>pair_coeff * * Si Si Si C 
</PRE>
<P>The 1st 2 arguments must be * * so as to span all LAMMPS atom types.
The first three Si arguments map LAMMPS atom types 1,2,3 to Si as
defined within KIM.  The final C argument maps LAMMPS atom type 4 to C
as defined within KIM.  If a mapping value is specified as NULL, the
mapping is not performed.  This can be used when a <I>kim</I> potential is
used as part of the <I>hybrid</I> pair style.  The NULL values are
placeholders for atom types that will be used with other potentials.
</P>

<P>Where to look for error messages
</P>
<P>Some of the KIM models might fail to work with lammps. Check generated
kim.log file for error messages.
</P>
<HR>

<P>How to build KIM
</P>
<P>ENV variables
</P>
<P>setenv KIM_MODELS_DIR `pwd`/MODELs/
setenv KIM_DIR `pwd`/
setenv KIM_DYNAMIC yes
</P>
<P>It is required that OPENKIM directory with
needed file structure is installed (can be downloaded from openkim.org)
and needed environment variables are set:
KIM_DIR = path  openkim-api directory
KIM_DYNAMIC -- if dynamic linking is used during building (default --static) 
KIM_MODELS_DIR = path to kim models directory (default -- $KIM_DIR/MODELs)
See openkim-api/INSTALL for detailed instruction.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info</B>:
</P>
<P>This pair style does not support the <A HREF = "pair_modify.html">pair_modify</A>
mix, shift, table, and tail options.
</P>
<P>This pair style does not write its information to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>, since KIM stores the the potential parameters.
Thus, you need to re-specify the pair_style and pair_coeff commands in
an input script that reads a restart file.
</P>
<P>This pair style can only be used via the <I>pair</I> keyword of the
<A HREF = "run_style.html">run_style respa</A> command.  It does not support the
<I>inner</I>, <I>middle</I>, <I>outer</I> keywords.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This pair style is part of the KIM package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info.
</P>
<P>This pair style requires the <A HREF = "newton.html">newton</A> setting to be "off"
for pair interactions.
</P>
<P>Currently this pair style only works with LAMMPS metal
<A HREF = "units.html">units</A>, since KIM models are written using
those units.
</P>
<P>Only KIM models that are using NEIGH-PURE-H, NEIGH-PURE-F and
NEIGH-RVEC-F can be used with lammps. (see KIM documentation on NBC
methods)
