fix_modify command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix_modify fix-ID keyword value ... :pre

fix-ID = ID of the fix to modify :ulb,l
one or more keyword/value pairs may be appended :l
keyword = {temp} or {energy} or {thermo} :l
  {temp} value = temperature ID
  {energy} value = {yes} or {no}
  {thermo} value = {yes} or {no} :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

fix_modify 3 temp myTemp
fix_modify 1 thermo yes energy no :pre

[Description:]

Modify one or more parameters of a previously defined fix.  Not all
fix styles support all parameters.

The {temp} keyword is used to determine how a fix computes
temperature.  The specified temperature ID must have been previously
defined by the user via the "temperature"_temperature.html command.
The default setting for {temp} is temperature ID = {default}.  Fix
styles that use the {temp} setting are
"temp/rescale"_fix_temp_rescale.html, "nvt"_fix_nvt.html, and
"npt"_fix_npt.html.

The {energy} and {thermo} keywords enable a fix to compute and/or
print quantities as part of the thermodynamic output to the screen and
log file (if the fix defines such quantities).  When the {energy}
keyword is set to {yes}, the fix computes a contribution to the total
potential energy that is printed as PotEng during thermodynamic
output.  When the {thermo} keyword is set to yes, the fix prints one
or more values that are appended to the list of thermodynamic outputs.
See the "thermo_style"_thermo_style.html command for how this printing
is formatted.

The fixes that support the {energy} and {thermo} options include: "fix
indent"_fix_indent.html, "fix nvt"_fix_nvt.html, "fix
nph"_fix_nph.html, "fix npt"_fix_npt.html, "fix
orient/fcc"_fix_orient_fcc.html, "fix
temp/rescale"_fix_temp_rescale.html, and "fix
wall/lj93"_fix_wall_lj93.html.  See the individual fix commands for
more info on what is computed and/or printed.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:]

"fix"_fix.html, "temperature"_temperature.html,
"thermo_style"_thermo_style.html

[Default:]

The option defaults are temp = default, energy = no, thermo = no.
