pair_style morse command :h3
pair_style morse/gpu command :h3
pair_style morse/opt command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style morse cutoff :pre
pair_style morse/gpu cutoff :pre
pair_style morse/opt cutoff :pre

cutoff = global cutoff for Morse interactions (distance units) :ul

[Examples:]

pair_style morse 2.5
pair_style morse/opt 2.5
pair_coeff * * 100.0 2.0 1.5
pair_coeff 1 1 100.0 2.0 1.5 3.0 :pre

[Description:]

Style {morse} computes pairwise interactions with the formula

:c,image(Eqs/pair_morse.jpg)

Rc is the cutoff.

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atoms
types via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command as in the examples
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
"read_data"_read_data.html or "read_restart"_read_restart.html
commands:

D0 (energy units)
alpha (1/distance units)
r0 (distance units)
cutoff (distance units) :ul

The last coefficient is optional.  If not specified, the global morse
cutoff is used.

Style (morse/opt} is an optimized version of style {eam}.  See
more details below.

Style {morse/gpu} is a GPU-enabled version of style {morse}.
See more details below.

The styles with an {opt} suffix are identical to the corresponding
styles without the suffix, except that it is written in an optimized
fashion for faster CPU execution.  See "this
section"_doc/Section_accerate.html of the manual for more details.

The styles with a {gpu} suffix are identical to the corresponding
styles without the suffix, except that each processor off-loads its
pairwise calculations to a GPU.  Depending on the hardware available
on your system this can provide a speed-up.  See "this
section"_doc/Section_accerate.html of the manual for more details.

Additional requirements in your input script to run the styles with a
{gpu} suffix are as follows:

The "newton pair"_newton.html setting must be {off} and the "fix
gpu"_fix_gpu.html command must be used.  The fix controls the GPU
selection and initialization steps.

[Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info]:

None of these pair styles support mixing.  Thus, coefficients for all
I,J pairs must be specified explicitly.

All of these pair styles support the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html
shift option for the energy of the pair interaction.

The "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html table options is not relevant for
the Morse pair styles.

None of these pair styles support the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html
tail option for adding long-range tail corrections to energy and
pressure.

All of these pair styles write their information to "binary restart
files"_restart.html, so pair_style and pair_coeff commands do not need
to be specified in an input script that reads a restart file.

These pair styles can only be used via the {pair} keyword of the
"run_style respa"_run_style.html command.  They do not support the
{inner}, {middle}, {outer} keywords.

[Restrictions:]

The styles with an {opt} or {gpu} suffix are part of the "opt" or
"gpu" packages.  They are only enabled if LAMMPS was built with those
packages.  See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#2_3 section for
more info.
