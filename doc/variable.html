</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command assigns one or more values to a variable name so that the
variable can be used in subsequent input script commands or its value
output during a simulation.  The "name" of the variable is an
arbitrary string.  Each "value" is a string which could be text or
numbers, as in the examples above.
</P>
<P>As explained in <A HREF = "Section_commands.html#3_2">this section</A>, occurrences
of the variable name in an input script line are replaced by the
variable's value.  The variable name can be referenced in the input
script as $x if the name "x" is a single character, or as ${LoopVar}
if the name "LoopVar" is one or more characters.
</P>
<P>Variable values can also be accessed for output once or periodically
during a simulation by the <A HREF = "print.html">print</A> command, <A HREF = "fix_print.html">fix
print</A> command, <A HREF = "run.html">run every</A> command, and the
<A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermo_style</A> command.
</P>
<HR>

<P>As described below, for variable styles <I>index</I>, <I>loop</I>, <I>universe</I>,
and <I>uloop</I>, the value assigned to a variable can be incremented via
the <A HREF = "next.html">next</A> command.  When there are no more values to
assign, the variable is "exhausted" and a flag is set that causes the
next <A HREF = "jump.html">jump</A> command encountered in the input script to be
skipped.  This enables the construction of simple loops in the input
script that are iterated over and exited from.
</P>
<P>When a variable command is encountered for a variable that has already
been specified, the command is ignored.  This allows an input script
with a variable command to be processed multiple times; see the
<A HREF = "jump.html">jump</A> or <A HREF = "include.html">include</A> commands.  It also means
that the use of the command-line switch -var will override a
corresponding variable setting in the input script.
</P>
<P>There are two exceptions to this rule. The first is for <I>equal</I> style
variables.  They are re-defined each time a variable command using an
equal-style variable is encountered.  Also, if a variable is iterated
on to the end of its list via the <A HREF = "next.html">next</A> command, it is
available to be re-defined in a subsequent variable command.
</P>
<HR>

<P>For the <I>index</I> style, one or more strings are specified.  Initially,
the 1st string is assigned to the variable.  Each time a
<A HREF = "next.html">next</A> command is used with the variable name, the next
string is assigned.  All processors assign the same string to the
variable.  <I>Index</I>-style variables can also be set (with a single
value) by using the command-line switch -var; see <A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_6">this
section</A> for details.
</P>
<P>The <I>loop</I> style is identical to the <I>index</I> style except that the
strings are the integers from 1 to N.  This allows you to generate a
long list of runs (e.g. 1000) without having to list N values in your
input script.  Initially, the string "1" is assigned to the variable.
Each time a <A HREF = "next.html">next</A> command is used with the variable name,
the next string ("2", "3", etc) is assigned.  All processors assign
the same string to the variable.
</P>
<P>For the <I>world</I> style, one or more strings are specified.  There must
be one string for each processor partition or "world".  See <A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_6">this
section</A> of the manual for information on
running LAMMPS with multiple partitions via the "-partition"
command-line switch.  This variable command assigns one string to each
world.  All processors in the world are assigned the same string.  The
next command cannot be used with <I>equal</I>-style variables, since there
is only one value per world.  This style of variable is useful when
you wish to run different simulations on different partitions, or when
performing a parallel tempering simulation (see the
<A HREF = "temper.html">temper</A> command), to assign different temperatures to
different partitions.
</P>
<P>For the <I>universe</I> style, one or more strings are specified.  There
must be at least as many strings as there are processor partitions or
"worlds".  See <A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_6">this page</A> for information on
running LAMMPS with multiple partitions via the "-partition"
command-line switch.  This variable command initially assigns one
string to each world.  When a <A HREF = "next.html">next</A> command is encountered
using this variable, the first processor partition to encounter it, is
assigned the next available value.  This continues until all the
variable values are consumed.  Thus, this command can be used to run
50 simulations on 8 processor partitions.  The simulations will be run
one after the other on whatever partition becomes available, until
they are all finished.  <I>Universe</I>-style variables are incremented
using the files "tmp.lammps.variable" and "tmp.lammps.variable.lock"
which you will see in your directory during such a LAMMPS run.
</P>
<P>The <I>uloop</I> style is identical to the <I>universe</I> style except that the
strings are the integers from 1 to N.  This allows you to generate a
long list of runs (e.g. 1000) without having to list N values in your
input script.
</P>
<HR>

<P>For the <I>equal</I> style, a single string is specified which represents
an equation that will be evaluated afresh each time the variable is
used.  Thus the variable can take on different values at different
stages of the input script.  For example, if the variable is used in a
<A HREF = "fix_print.html">fix print</A> command, different values could be printed
each timestep it was invoked.  The next command cannot be used with
<I>equal</I>-style variables, since there is only one value.
</P>
<P>The equation for an <I>equal</I>-style variable can contain a variety of
quantities.  The syntax for each kind of quantity is simple, but
multiple quantities can be nested and combined in various ways to
build up formulas of arbitrary complexity.  For example, this is a
valid (though strange) variable equation:
</P>
<PRE>variable x equal div(add(pe,c_MyTemp[0]),pow(vol,div(1,3))) 
</PRE>
<P>Specifically, an equation can contain numbers, thermo keywords, math
functions, group functions, atom vectors, compute references, and
other variables:
</P>
<DIV ALIGN=center><TABLE  WIDTH="0%"  BORDER=1 >
<TR><TD >Number</TD><TD > 0.2, 1.0e20, -15.4, etc</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >Thermo keywords</TD><TD > vol, pe, ebond, etc</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >Math functions</TD><TD > add(x,y), sub(x,y), mult(x,y), div(x,y),   neg(x), pow(x,y), exp(x), ln(x), sqrt(x)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >Group functions</TD><TD > mass(ID), charge(ID), xcm(ID,dim), vcm(ID,dim),   bound(ID,dir), gyration(ID)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >Atom vectors</TD><TD > x[N], y[N], z[N], vx[N], vy[N], vz[N],                    fx[N], fy[N], fz[N]</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >Compute references</TD><TD > c_ID[0], c_ID[N]</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >Other variables</TD><TD > v_abc, v_x, etc 
</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV>

<P>The thermo keywords allowed in the equation are those defined by the
"thermo_style custom" command.  Note that many thermodyanmic
quantities are only computable after the first simulation has begun.
Likewise, many thermodynamic quantities (such as energies) are only
computed on timesteps when thermodyanmic output is being performed.
If the variable equation these quantities at other times, out-of-date
or invalid values may be used.
</P>
<P>Math functions take one or two arguments, each of which may be an
equation containing any of the quantities defined above.  This allows
equations to be nested, as in the examples above.
</P>
<P>Group functions take one or two arguments.  The first argument is the
group-ID.  The <I>dim</I> argument is <I>x</I> or <I>y</I> or <I>z</I>.  The <I>dir</I>
argument is <I>xmin</I>, <I>xmax</I>, <I>ymin</I>, <I>ymax</I>, <I>zmin</I>, or <I>zmax</I>.  The
group functions mass() and charge() are the total mass and charge of
the group of atoms.  Xcm() and vcm() return components of the position
and velocity of the center of mass of the group.  Bound() returns the
min/max of a particular coordinate for all atoms in the group.
Gyration() computes the radius-of-gyration of the group of atoms.  See
the <A HREF = "fix_gyration.html">fix gyration</A> command for the formula.
</P>
<P>The atom vectors take a single integer argument from 1-N, which
is the desired atom-ID, e.g. x[243].
</P>
<P>Compute references access allow access to scalar or vector quantities
calculated by a compute.  The ID in the reference should be replaced
by the actual ID of the compute that has been defined elsewhere in the
input script.  See the <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> command for details.
Note that per-atom quantities calcalated by a compute cannot be
accessed this way, but only global scalar or vector quantities.
</P>
<P>If <I>c_ID[0]</I> is used as a keyword, then the scalar quantity
calculated by the compute is printed.  If <I>c_ID[N]</I> is used, then N
in the range from 1-M will print a specific component of the vector
calculated by the compute.
</P>
<P>The current values of other variables can be accessed by prepending a
"v_" to the variable name.  This will cause the other variable to be
evaulated.  Note that if you do something circular like this:
</P>
<PRE>variable a equal v_b
variable b equal v_a
print $a 
</PRE>
<P>then LAMMPS will run for a while when the print statement is invoked.
</P>
<P>Note that there is a subtle difference between using a variable
in a <I>equal</I>-style equation in the form $x versus v_x.
</P>
<P>In the former case, as with any other input script command, the
variable's value is substituted for immediately when the line is read
from the input script.  Thus if the current simulation box volume was
1000.0, then these lines:
</P>
<PRE>variable x equal vol
variable y equal mult($x,2) 
</PRE>
<P>would associate the equation string "mult(1000.0,2)" with variable y.
</P>
<P>By contrast, these lines:
</P>
<PRE>variable x equal vol
variable y equal mult(v_x,2) 
</PRE>
<P>would associate the equation string "mult(v_x,2)" with variable y.
</P>
<P>Thus if the variable y were evaluated periodically during a run where
the box volume changed, the resulting value would always be 500.0 for
the first case, but would change dynamically for the second case.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>The use of atom vectors in <I>equal</I> style variables requires the atom
style to use a global mapping in order to look up the vector indices.
Only atom styles with molecular information create global maps unless
the <A HREF = "atom_modify.html">atom_modify map</A> command is used.
