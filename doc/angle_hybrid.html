<H3>angle_style hybrid command 
</H3>
<H3>angle_style hybrid/omp command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>angle_style hybrid style1 style2 ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>style1,style2 = list of one or more angle styles 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>angle_style hybrid harmonic cosine
angle_coeff 1 harmonic 80.0 30.0
angle_coeff 2* cosine 50.0  
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The <I>hybrid</I> style enables the use of multiple angle styles in one
simulation.  An angle style is assigned to each angle type.  For
example, angles in a polymer flow (of angle type 1) could be computed
with a <I>harmonic</I> potential and angles in the wall boundary (of angle
type 2) could be computed with a <I>cosine</I> potential.  The assignment
of angle type to style is made via the <A HREF = "angle_coeff.html">angle_coeff</A>
command or in the data file.
</P>
<P>In the angle_coeff commands, the name of an angle style must be added
after the angle type, with the remaining coefficients being those
appropriate to that style.  In the example above, the 2 angle_coeff
commands set angles of angle type 1 to be computed with a <I>harmonic</I>
potential with coefficients 80.0, 30.0 for K, theta0.  All other angle
types (2-N) are computed with a <I>cosine</I> potential with coefficient
50.0 for K.
</P>
<P>If angle coefficients are specified in the data file read via the
<A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> command, then the same rule applies.
E.g. "harmonic" or "cosine", must be added after the angle type, for each
line in the "Angle Coeffs" section, e.g.
</P>
<PRE>Angle Coeffs 
</PRE>
<PRE>1 harmonic 80.0 30.0
2 cosine 50.0
... 
</PRE>
<P>If <I>class2</I> is one of the angle hybrid styles, the same rule holds for
specifying additional BondBond (and BondAngle) coefficients either via
the input script or in the data file.  I.e. <I>class2</I> must be added to
each line after the angle type.  For lines in the BondBond (or
BondAngle) section of the data file for angle types that are not
<I>class2</I>, you must use an angle style of <I>skip</I> as a placeholder, e.g.
</P>
<PRE>BondBond Coeffs 
</PRE>
<PRE>1 skip
2 class2 3.6512 1.0119 1.0119
... 
</PRE>
<P>Note that it is not necessary to use the angle style <I>skip</I> in the
input script, since BondBond (or BondAngle) coefficients need not be
specified at all for angle types that are not <I>class2</I>.
</P>
<P>An angle style of <I>none</I> with no additional coefficients can be used
in place of an angle style, either in a input script angle_coeff
command or in the data file, if you desire to turn off interactions
for specific angle types.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Styles with a <I>cuda</I>, <I>gpu</I>, <I>omp</I>, or <I>opt</I> suffix are functionally
the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.  They have
been optimized to run faster, depending on your available hardware,
as discussed in <A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">this section</A> of the manual.
</P>
<P>Since the <I>hybrid</I> style delegates computation to the individual 
sub-styles, the suffix versions of the <I>hybrid</I> styles are used 
to propagate the corresponding suffix to all sub-styles, if those
accelerated versions exist. Otherwise the non-accelerated version
will be used.
</P>
<P>The individual accelerated sub-styles are part of the USER-CUDA, GPU,
USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the
<A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making LAMMPS</A> section for more info.
</P>
<P>You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_6">-suffix command-line
switch</A> when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can
use the <A HREF = "suffix.html">suffix</A> command in your input script.
</P>
<P>See <A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">this section</A> of the manual for more
instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This angle style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
MOLECULAR package (which it is by default).  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info on packages.
</P>
<P>Unlike other angle styles, the hybrid angle style does not store angle
coefficient info for individual sub-styles in a <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.  Thus when retarting a simulation from a restart
file, you need to re-specify angle_coeff commands.
