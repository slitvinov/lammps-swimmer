<H3>compute displace/atom command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>compute ID group-ID displace/atom 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID, group-ID are documented in <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> command
<LI>displace/atom = style name of this compute command 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>compute 1 all displace/atom 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a computation that calculates the current displacement of each
atom in the group from its original coordinates, including all effects
due to atoms passing thru periodic boundaries.  Four quantites per
atom are computed: the x,y,z displacements and the total displacement.
See below for details.
</P>
<P>To store the original coordinates at the time this compute is issued,
the compute creates its own fix of style "coord/original", as if this
command had been issued:
</P>
<PRE>fix compute-ID_coord_original group-ID coord/original 
</PRE>
<P>See the <A HREF = "fix_coord_original.html">fix coord/original</A> command for
details.  Note that the ID of the new fix is the compute-ID +
underscore + "coord_original", and the group for the new fix is
the same as the compute group.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: Fix coord/original stores the initial coordinates in
"unwrapped" form, by using the image flags associated with each atom.
See the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump custom</A> command for a discussion of
"unwrapped" coordinates.  See the Atoms section of the
<A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> command for a discussion of image flags and
how they are set for each atom.  You can reset the image flags
(e.g. to 0) before invoking this compute by using the <A HREF = "set.html">set
image</A> command.
</P>
<P>The displacements can be output directly via the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump
custom</A> command.
</P>
<P>The value of the displacement will be 0.0 for atoms not in the
specified compute group.
</P>
<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>This compute calculates a vector of length 4 for each atom, which can
be accessed by indices 1-4 by any command that uses per-atom computes
as input.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#4_15">this section</A> for an overview
of LAMMPS output options.  The first 3 components of the vector are
the x,y,z displacements.  The 4th component is the total displacement,
i.e. sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy + dz*dz).
