<H3>pair_style meam/spline

<P><B>Examples:</B>

<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The <I>meam/spline</I> style computes pairwise interactions for metals
using a variant of modified embedded-atom method (MEAM) potentials
<A HREF = "#Lenosky">(Lenosky)</A>.  The total energy E is given by
</P>

<P>with the density at atom i
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/pair_meam_spline_2.png">
</CENTER>
<P>where theta_jik is the angle between atoms j, i, and k centered on
atom i. The five functions Phi, U, rho, f, and g are represented by
cubic splines.
</P>
<P>The cutoffs and the coefficients for these spline functions are listed
in a parameter file which is specified by the
<A HREF = "pair_coeff.html">pair_coeff</A> command.  Parameter files for different
elements are included in the "potentials" directory of the LAMMPS
distribution and have a ".meam.spline" file suffix.  All of these
files are parameterized in terms of LAMMPS <A HREF = "units.html">metal units</A>.
</P>
<P>Note that unlike for other potentials, cutoffs for spline-based MEAM
potentials are not set in the pair_style or pair_coeff command; they
are specified in the potential files themselves.
</P>
<P>Unlike the EAM pair style, which retrieves the atomic mass from the
potential file, the spline-based MEAM potentials do not include mass
information; thus you need to use the <A HREF = "mass.html">mass</A> command to
specify it.
</P>
<P>Only a single pair_coeff command is used with the <I>meam/spline</I> style
which specifies the spline-based MEAM potential file:
</P>
<UL><LI>meam/spline potential file 
</UL>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: The <I>meam/spline</I> style currently supports only
single-element MEAM potentials.  Thus it cannot be used with
<A HREF = "pair_hybrid.html">pair_style hybrid</A> command, and with a NULL syntax
in the pair_coeff command, as used by other many-body potentials, to
determine what subset of atom types to apply the potential to.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info</B>:
</P>
<P>The current version of this pair style does not support multiple
element types or mixing.  It has been designed for pure elements only.
</P>
<P>This pair style does not support the <A HREF = "pair_modify.html">pair_modify</A>
shift, table, and tail options.
</P>
<P>The <I>meam/spline</I> pair style does not write its information to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary
restart files</A>, since it is stored in an external
potential parameter file.  Thus, you need to re-specify the pair_style
and pair_coeff commands in an input script that reads a restart file.
</P>
<P>The <I>meam/spline</I> pair style can only be used via the <I>pair</I> keyword of the
<A HREF = "run_style.html">run_style respa</A> command.  They do not support the
<I>inner</I>, <I>middle</I>, <I>outer</I> keywords.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This pair style requires the <A HREF = "newton.html">newton</A> setting to be "on"
for pair interactions.
</P>
<P>This pair style is only enabled if LAMMPS was built with the USER-MISC
package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making LAMMPS</A> section
for more info.
