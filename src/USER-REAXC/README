PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:

Contains a implementation for LAMMPS of the ReaxFF force field.
ReaxFF uses distance-dependent bond-order functions to represent the
contributions of chemical bonding to the potential energy.  It was
originally developed by Adri van Duin and the Goddard group at
CalTech.

The USER-REAXC version of ReaxFF (pair_style reax/c), implemented in
C, should give identical or very similar results to pair_style reax,
which is a ReaxFF implementation on top of a Fortran library, a
version of which was originally authored by Adri van Duin.

The reax/c version should be somewhat faster and more scalable,
particularly with respect to the charge equilibration calculation.  It
should also be easier to build and use since there are no complicating
issues due to linking to a Fortran library.

OTHERS FILES INCLUDED:

User examples for pair_style reax/c are in examples/reax.

Thanks to Steve Plimpton and Aidan Thompson for their input on the
LAMMPS architecture and for their help in understanding and
customizing some of the required LAMMPS interfaces.
