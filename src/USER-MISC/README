The files in this directory are a potpourri of (mostly) unrelated
features contributed to LAMMPS by users.  Each feature is a single
file (actually a *.cpp and *.h file).

More information about each feature can be found by reading its doc
page in the LAMMPS doc directory.  This link points to the doc
page for all LAMMPS input script commands:

http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Section_commands.html#3_5\

User-contributed features are listed at the bottom of the fix,
compute, pair, etc sections.

You should contact the author if you have specific questions about the
feature or its code.
