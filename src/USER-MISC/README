The files in this directory are a potpourri of (mostly) unrelated
features contributed to LAMMPS by users.  Each feature is a single
file (actually a *.cpp and *.h file).

More information about each feature can be found by reading its doc
page in the LAMMPS doc directory.  This link points to the doc
page for all LAMMPS commands:

http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Section_commands.html#3_5\

User-contributed features are listed at the bottom of the fix,
compute, pair, etc sections.

You should contact the author if you have specific questions about the
feature or its code.
