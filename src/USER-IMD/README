The files in this directory are a user-contributed package for LAMMPS.

The person who created these files is Axel Kohlmeyer
(akohlmey@gmail.com).  Contact him directly if you 
have questions or for example scripts that use it.

This package implements a "fix imd" command which can be used in a
LAMMPS input script.  IMD stands for interactive molecular dynamics,
and allows realtime visualization and manipulation of MD simulations
through the IMD protocol, initially implemented in VMD and NAMD.

If LAMMPS is compiled with the preprocessor flag -DLAMMPS_ASYNC_IMD
then fix imd will use posix threads to spawn a thread on MPI rank 0
in order to offload data reading and writing from the main execution
thread and potentiall lower the inferred latencies for slow 
communication links. This feature has only been tested under linux.

There are example scripts for using this package with LAMMPS in
examples/USER/imd. Additional examples and a driver for use with the 
Novint Falcon game controller as haptic device can be found at:

This software includes code developed by the Theoretical and Computational 
Biophysics Group in the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and 
Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
