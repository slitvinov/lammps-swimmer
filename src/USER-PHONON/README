This package contains a method to measure the dynamical matrices, and
consequently the phonon dispersion, directly from molecular dynamics
simulations.  It is implemented as a fix phonon command.

See the doc page for the fix phonon command for detailed usage
instructions.

The compiling of this package along with LAMMPS requires that the FFT3d
wrappers from the kspace package of LAMMPS be included as well.

There are example scripts for using this package in
examples/USER/phonon.

There is an auxiliary post-processing tool for using this package in
tools/phonon.

The person who created this package is Ling-Ti Kong (konglt at
sjtu.edu.cn).  Contact him directly if you have questions.
