This package provides an C++ interface class to the VMD molfile
plugins, http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/molfile, and a
set of LAMMPS classes that use this interface.

Molfile plugins provide a consistent programming interface to read and
write file formats commonly used in molecular simulations.  The
package only provides the interface code, not the plugins; these can
be obtained from a VMD installation which has to match the platform
that you are using to compile LAMMPS for. By adding plugins, support
for new file formats can be added to LAMMPS (or VMD or other programs
that use them) without having to recompile the application itself.
The plugins are installed in the directory:
<VMDHOME>/plugins/<VMDARCH>/molfile

NOTE: while the programming interface (API) to the plugins is backward
compatible, the binary interface (ABI) has been changing over time, so
it is necessary to compile this package with the plugin header files
from VMD that match the binary plugins.  These header files in the
directory: <VMDHOME>/plugins/include For convenience, the package
ships with a set of header files that are compatible with VMD 1.9 and
1.9.1 (the current version in June 2012)
