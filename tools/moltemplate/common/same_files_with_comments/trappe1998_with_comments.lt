# This file contains force field parameters for the "TraPPE" potential used 
# to model conformational change and interactions between coarse-grained 
# alkane chains.  This is a united-atom model. (Hydrogens are not represented 
# explicitly.)  This model is described in more detail here:

# ---- Force-Field File Format explanation ----
#
# Lammps-template files (LT files) contain object defintions like this:
#
# OBJECT_NAME {
#   write commands { text and @ and $ variables...}
# }
#
#    Often these objects are definitions of molecules 
# which can be copied or pasted together to build larger molecules. 
#
#    However this file defines the static "TraPPE" object.
# "TraPPE" is not a molecule, but a collection of atom types, 
# and a description of the interactions between them.
# These atoms can then be used inside other molecules.
# So you can think of the "TraPPE" object as an environment (namespace)
# describing the interactions between a limited set of atoms.
# Later on whenever you build a new molecule using TraPPE atoms, 
#     (for example using this syntax "@atom:.../TraPPE/CH2"), 
# then the forces between them will be generated automatically.
#
# The dihedral (torsion) angle forces are given by
# U_dihedral(x) =
#  = 0.5*(1.411036*(1+cos(x)) - 0.271016*(1-cos(2*x)) + 3.145034*(1+cos(3*x)))
# Note: The TraPPE authors suggest using bond-constraints like "SHAKE".
#       Unfortunatley, in LAMMPS, SHAKE does not work for large molecules.
# Units:
# Energies in this file are in kCal/mole. (Where k_B = 0.001987207 in units of
# kCal mole^(-1) Kelvin^(-1), and 1 "thermochemical" calorie = 4.184000 Joule)
