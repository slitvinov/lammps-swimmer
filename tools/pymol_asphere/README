asphere_vis: Tool for triangulating aspherical particles
	     to convert LAMMPS output to PyMol input

Building the tool:

cd src
make       # may need to edit Makefile for your system

This will place the asphere_vis executable in the bin directory.

Documentation is in the doc directory.  Note that the doc file says
the ellipsoid axes are specified by an "Ellipsoid" section in the data
file.  In the current version of LAMPS, this is now a "Shapes"
section.

See instructions on how to run an example ellipsoid viz in the
examples dir.
