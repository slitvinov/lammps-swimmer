This directory contains Python code which wraps LAMMPS as a library
and allows the library interface to be invoked from a Python, either
from a script or interactively.

Details on how to build and use this Python interface are given in
doc/Section_python.html.

Basically you have to extend the Python on your box to include the
LAMMPS wrappers:

python setup_serial.py build           # for serial LAMMPS and Python
sudo python setup_serial.py install

python setup.py build                  # for parallel LAMMPS and Python
sudo python setuppy install

but there are several issues to be aware of, as discussed in the doc
pages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have successfully built and tested the wrappers, you can run
the Python scripts in the examples sub-directory:

trivial.py      read/run a LAMMPS input script thru Python
demo.py		invoke various LAMMPS library interface routines
simple.py	mimic operation of couple/simple/simple.cpp in Python
gui.py		GUI go/stop/temperature-slider to control LAMMPS
plot.py		real-time temeperature plot with GnuPlot via Pizza.py
viz.py		real-time viz from GL tool in Pizza.py
vizplotgui.py   combination of viz.py and plot.py and gui.py

Run them with the following input scripts and arguments:

trivial.py in.trivial
demo.py
simple.py in.simple
gui.py in.gui 100
plot.py in.plot 10 1000 thermo_temp
viz.py in.viz 100 5000
vizplotgui.py in.viz 100 thermo_temp

You can un-comment the Pypar calls if you want to run these in
parallel.

Each script has more documentation at the top of the file that
explains how to use it.
