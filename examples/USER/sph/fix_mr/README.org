Dot pattern generation technique using smoothed particle
hydrodynamics.

In computer graphics the problem of stippling can be formulated as
follows: given a grayscale image and the number of circular black dots
of equal size to generate a distribution of dots matching the tones of
the image; in addition the distribution should be free of sampling
artifacts. Such a distribution (even, isotropic, yet unstructured) is
often called "blue noise".

We present a novel algorithm to generate blue noise distribution using
multiresolution smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). The method
involves iterative displacements of dots starting from a structured
configuration closely matching the image. The method can take
advantage of parallels implementations and performance tweaks in
existing SPH packages. Simple physical interpretation of the method
allows for intuitive extensions to more complex problems (sampling on
surfaces, sampling in high dimensions, sampling with non-positional
factors).
