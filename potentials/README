This directory contains potential files for different elements and
alloys, as used by LAMMPS for various pair styles.  See the
description of the "pair_style" and "pair_coeff" commands for details
of the file formats and the various styles in LAMMPS that read these
files.

The suffix of each file indicates the pair style it is used with:

eam	      embedded atom method (EAM) single element, DYNAMO funcfl format
eam.alloy     EAM multi-element alloy, DYNAMO setfl format
eam.fs	      Finnis-Sinclair EAM multi-element alloy
meam	      modified EAM (MEAM) library and individual elements/alloys
sw	      Stillinger-Weber potential
tersoff	      Tersoff potential
airebo	      AI-REBO (Brenner) potential
