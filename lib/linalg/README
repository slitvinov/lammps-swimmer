This directory has BLAS and LAPACK files needed by the USER-ATC and
USER-AWPMD packages, and possibly other packages in the future.

You should only need to build and use the files in this directory if
you want to build LAMMPS with the a package that needs BLAS/LAPACK
routines and do not have the standard BLAS and LAPACK libraries on
your system.

Use one of the Makefiles provided to build this library.
You may need to edit if for your system.

When you are done building this library, one file should
exist in this directory:

liblinalg.a		the library LAMMPS will link against

You can then include this library and its path in any packages that
need it, e.g. in the lib/atc/Makefile.lammps file.
