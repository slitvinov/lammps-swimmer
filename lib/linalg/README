This directory has BLAS and LAPACK files needed by the USER-ATC and
USER-AWPMD packages, and possibly by other packages in the future.

You only need to build and use the files in this directory if you want
to build LAMMPS with a package that needs BLAS/LAPACK routines and you
do not have the standard BLAS and LAPACK libraries on your system.

Build the library using one of the provided Makefile.* files or create
your own, specific to your compiler and system.  For example:

make -f Makefile.gfortran

When you are done building this library, one file should exist in this
directory:

liblinalg.a		the library LAMMPS will link against

You can then include this library and its path in the Makefile.lammps
file of any packages that need it, e.g. in lib/atc/Makefile.lammps.
