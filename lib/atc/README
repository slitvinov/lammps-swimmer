ATC (Atom To Continuum methods)

--------------

This is version 1.0 of the ATC library, which provides continuum field
estimation and molecular dynamics-finite element coupling methods.

This library must be built with a C++ compiler, before LAMMPS is
built, so LAMMPS can link against it. This library is dependent on the
system libraries MPI, BLAS and LAPACK which will be linked when LAMMPS
is built.

Build the library using one of the provided Makefiles or creating your
own, specific to your compiler and system.  For example:

make -f Makefile.g++

Note that the ATC library makes MPI calls, so you should
build it with the same MPI library that is used to build
LAMMPS, e.g. in the lammps/src/MAKE/Makefile.foo file.

If the build is successful, you should end up with a libatc.a file.
