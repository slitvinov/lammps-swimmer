This is version 1.0 of the ATC library, which provides continuum field
estimation and molecular dynamics-finite element coupling methods.

---------------------------

This directory has source files to build a library that LAMMPS
links against when using the USER-ATC package.

This library must be built with a C++ compiler, before LAMMPS is
built, so LAMMPS can link against it.

Build the library using one of the provided Makefiles or create your
own, specific to your compiler and system.  For example:

make -f Makefile.g++

Note that the ATC library makes MPI calls, so you must build it with
the same MPI library that is used to build LAMMPS, e.g. as specified
by settings in the lammps/src/MAKE/Makefile.foo file.

When you are done building this library, two files should
exist in this directory:

libatc.a		the library LAMMPS will link against
Makefile.lammps		settings the LAMMPS Makefile will import

Makefile.lammps is created by the make procedure, by making a copy of
one of the Makefile.lammps.* files.  See the EXTRAMAKE setting at the
top of the Makefile.* files.  It is IMPORTANT that you examine the
final Makefile.lammps to insure it is correct for your system, else
the LAMMPS build will likely fail.

Makefile.lammps has settings for 3 variables:

user-atc_SYSINC = leave blank for this package
user-atc_SYSLIB = additional system libraries needed by this package
user-atc_SYSPATH = path(s) to where those libraries are

SYSLIB must specify a BLAS library and a LAPACK library.  If they are
already installed on your system, the settings in
Makefile.lammps.installed should suffice.  If you want to use the
version provided with LAMMPS in lib/linalg, then the settings in
Makefile.lammps.linalg should work.  Note that in this case you also
need to build the linear-algebra in lib/linalg; see the
lib/linalg/README for more details.
