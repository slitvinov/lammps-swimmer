This dir contains the hooks to build and link LAMMPS with the VMD
molfile plugins, http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/molfile.

When you build LAMMPS with its USER-MOLFILE package installed, it will
use the 3 settings in Makefile.lammps in this directory.

molfile_SYSINC = should not need to be set
molfile_SYSLIB = the dl library called by the USER-MOLFILE source files
molfile_SYSPATH = a path to the dl library
